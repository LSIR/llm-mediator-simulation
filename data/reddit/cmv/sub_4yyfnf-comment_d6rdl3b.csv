"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","Eric Gardner, thanks u/CherrySlurpee, didn't die by accident. 

He died from the unnecessary choke hold. His past criminal history is irrelevant.


T. Rice was a 12 year old boy playing with a toy gun in a park. Which is stupid, but something that 12 year olds do a lot. 

The cops drove up to him and seconds later shot him.

This tactic was used over other tactics that could have not ended with a dead 12 year old.  ","1471833508"
"quwertie","quwertie","Eric gartner died because he was advancing on cops and refusing to put his hands up while repeating ""this ends now.""

Tamir rice died because he pointed a realistic looking gun at people and cops and also looked like an adult. ","1471849763"
"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","He died from a choke hold. 

Resisting arrest in the way that he did isn't a capital offense. 

I don't care if Rice looks like an adult. That's not a defense for the action of the officer. 

1.5 seconds ticks by from the the cop car gets on scene to the fatal shot. 

1.5 seconds. 

Have you seen the video.?","1471850836"
"quwertie","quwertie","An officer killing someone isn't a death sentence, it's an act of self defense. 

Tamir looking like an adult is vitally important. Imagine the officers perspective. Get a call for someone pointing a gun at people. You drive up, yell hands up, and they start running and grabbing the gun. You don't want to die today, so you take the shot. The number of seconds is such a dumb, irrelevant meme made to obfuscate the situation. A lot can happen in a couple seconds. ","1471851156"
"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","No one had to die that day. 

1.5 is the time from when the officer drove his car five feet away till that officer fired. 

DO you really think that an officer who was fired from his last job for:a ""dangerous loss of composure"", dismal handling of a firearm and someone who showed a pattern of a lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions properly handled that situation?","1471852046"

"quwertie","quwertie","I know what to say to you. Being a cop is one of the most dangerous jobs there is, you deal with people who can kill you on a regular basis. I will absolutely defend a cop who reasonably thought he could be killed if he did not discharge his firearm. ","1471854460"

Are you basing this on facts or just your opinion?

You may defend the police any time you wish, but you take the time to examine the case and not just always take the police officers side. 

Police have asked a man for his ID and then shot him as he was reaching for his ID. 

I'm sure you would defend that situation as well. ","1471854828"
