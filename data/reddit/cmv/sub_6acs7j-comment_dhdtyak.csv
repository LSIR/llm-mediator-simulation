"readerwritermaybe","readerwritermaybe","The ""investigation"" is a farce and anyone who thinks there is any legitimacy to the russia conspiracy is beyond reason already.

Edit: Oh wow, look at all that **actual evidence** you downvoters don't have.","1494438519"
"trysmart_asshard","trysmart_asshard","Look at the sub you are posting in. ""Beyond reason"" will be a tough case to make.

Every weasel tactic is on the table, nowadays, is it? This is effectively just the ""how can you prove Glenn Beck didn't rape and murder a girl in 1991?"" meme.

But unironically. 

Which is actually kind of frightening.","1494441376"
