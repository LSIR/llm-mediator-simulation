He told the officer he had a gun and reached for his wallet.
However, this is the one time I have to give it to BLM. This one was absolutely disgusting and needlessly escalated.","1471836510"
"quwertie","quwertie","Nope, castiel earned his death. His gun was unlicensed and sitting on his lap (where he reached for it to try and shoot the cop). He had robbed a convience store a few days earlier too, and his car was the getaway vehicle. And the reason his girlfriend was so calm in the video? She was trying to cover her own ass, because she was a criminal too. And she was probably stoned, as evidenced by her Facebook posts in the past smoking joints and drinking henny with a kid in the backseat. ","1471850051"
"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","If his plan was to shoot a cop, why the hell would he announce to that cop that he has a gun. 

Why, and facts prove me correct, wouldn't he have just shot the officer. 

That makes no sense to announce that you have a gun and then proceed to use that gun on that officer. 

What you are saying happened makes zero sense. ","1471851018"

Why announce that you have a firearm and then use that firearm. 

That makes zero sense. You are suggesting things that make no sense 

People act irrationally and spontaneously in stressful situations 

But oddly you don't think that police are able to act irrationally and spontaneously right? So it people, minus all of those who are police officers. ","1471851740"
