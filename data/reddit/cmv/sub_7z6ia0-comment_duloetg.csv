"bruhle","bruhle","A few miles from my house on New Year’s Eve, a drunk driver crashed head on into a minivan with a family of six inside. Both parents, along with their four innocent children were killed. They didn’t choose that. ","1519229831"

"aerospce","aerospce","It is illegal to have and fire a gun in almost all the places mass shooting occur, especially schools. Just like drunk driving laws, they don't work in everyone.","1519230473"
"worldeditor","worldeditor","So is it your belief that we shouldn't have drunk driving laws, as they aren't 100% effective? If not, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. All accidents related to drunk driving take place in locations where it's illegal too. ","1519231119"
"FARTBOX_DESTROYER","FARTBOX_DESTROYER","His point is that regulating guns is analogous to regulating alcohol. Drunk driving laws are analogous to regulating murder, which we already do.

So regulating guns is taking an entirely different route.","1519233972"
"worldeditor","worldeditor","No, drunk driving laws regulate *alcohol* and *cars*. The point is that we should regulate *guns* in the same way. ","1519234639"
"AlphaGoGoDancer","AlphaGoGoDancer","Or to OP's point, if regulating alcohol and cars together isn't enough,  just like regulating using guns in schools isn't enough,  we should look at regulating alcohol independently like you suggest we regulate guns independently.","1519234810"
"staiano","staiano","""isn't enough"" doesn't mean stop trying, does it?  

We don't even try with guns over the last decade and just accept that mass shootings will occur.  Why is that, in your opinion?","1519235013"
"verylittlefinger","verylittlefinger","Yes we do try with guns. A lot of states enacted various anti-gun measures in the last 2 decades. You don’t hear about this because no one has shown that any of them made any difference.","1519240131"
"staiano","staiano","Sure and if you don't do it at a national level like background check you can't begin to know if it's actually effective.  ","1519243011"

""Local laws aren't effective without national laws.""

LOGIC!
