"Qpalzm112","Qpalzm112","I always thought the issue was how they overcharge for their products ","1534690826"

"Qpalzm112","Qpalzm112","If only... You can literally compare their phone specs to other phone specs and see the iPhone will be more expensive","1534736114"
"TheResPublica","TheResPublica","That’s not how prices work. Prices are determined by a consumer’s willingness to pay. If they were overcharging, they wouldn’t have customers.

Not to mention hardware specs do not equate to performance of the product. ","1534736218"
"Qpalzm112","Qpalzm112","Oh? So an Android with x specs sells for 500, but since people will buy an iPhone with x specs for 700, apple is not overcharging? By your explanation overcharging never occurs. (which is, of course, wrong)","1534736772"
"TheResPublica","TheResPublica","If a company sets the price too high, they don’t have enough customers to turn a profit. The new Blackberry devices come to mind... as do Sony electronics. 

Apple isn’t overcharging because they have millions of people who agree that the price they are setting is perfectly acceptable. So much so that they remain loyal customers for several generations of the device. 

I’m fairly certain you just don’t understand how pricing works","1534737032"
