Pro lifers, who believe that life begins at conception, believe that abortion is murder. We don't incentivize people to not be criminals, we deter them from committing crimes.","1455819971"
"Yuskie","Yuskie","If we were to view this logically, that would be the case. But based on the US justice system, you'll need facts to back up where life begins to actually consider it a murder. The start of life is controversial.

How would having the medical bills paid, and removing responsibility of the child be an incentive? Or at least make the cost of giving birth the same costs as an abortion? (I don't know anything about the price to be exact)","1455821207"

No, you don't, you just need enough people to agree on it.","1455823986"
"AintNoFortunateSon","AintNoFortunateSon","that's true, shouldn't be, but it is. get enough people to believe a lie and it becomes the truth. just look at religion. ","1455834912"
"MrF33","MrF33","Look at literally any moral or ethical position you hold.

There's no scientific proof that you have the right to free speech, or that murder is wrong.

Laws are universally the result of the beliefs of the society in which they are written.","1455835379"
"AintNoFortunateSon","AintNoFortunateSon","Murder is wrong on the basis of, I don't want to be murdered, so I don't murder others. Free speech is good on the basis of I don't want my speech limited, so I don't limit the speech of others. Laws are certainly the result of the beliefs of a society, that doesn't mean they're immune from the influence of natural laws. Gravity certainly doesn't care weather you believe in it or not. ","1455837608"
"MrF33","MrF33","You're combining two different things. 

Gravity is no more a ""law"" than ""light"" is, its a phenomenon.

Everything else you said was based on your beliefs and values.","1455837846"
"AintNoFortunateSon","AintNoFortunateSon","You're right, I should have been more specific and specified that I was referring to Newton's Law of Gravity. Anyhow, those beliefs and values are considered universal human rights and aren't as culturally biased and you seem to be implying. ","1455839297"
"MrF33","MrF33","I'm aware of what you were referring to, that doesn't make the analogy any more relevant.

At the end of the day,free speech, right to life, etc, are not universally accepted as rights. 

","1455840853"
"AintNoFortunateSon","AintNoFortunateSon","Except that they are accepted and ratified in the form of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was ratified in 1948. This isn't exactly a new idea. ","1455842510"
"MrF33","MrF33","So? That doesn't make them any more real than the belief that slavery is wrong, or that blue is the name of 450-490 nm photons.

No social law is any more real than the justifications we use to create it

"AintNoFortunateSon","AintNoFortunateSon","truth is, nothing's real. You're not real, I'm not real, the only thing that's real is the lie in your mind that makes you think it's real. And even that's not real. ","1455845382"
"MrF33","MrF33","Don't be pedantic.

Morals and ethics are not based on science, if all you care about is proof through science then you can never claim the moral high ground","1455846740"
