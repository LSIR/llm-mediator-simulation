"john_gee","john_gee","Are you arguing that without anti-discrimination laws, the free market will correct discrimination by way of bad publicity and boycotts? Or that discrimination is fine, so it’s irrelevant whether or not the market corrects it?","1538978480"
"ghatty09","ghatty09","Both. I personally do not like most discrimination, things people can’t control about themselves such as skin color or sex or eye color, things they’re born with. But if you choose to do something to yourself such as get tattoos , piercings, own horses, vote republican, “change”your gender, drive an electric car, then I definitely think that kind of discrimination is okay. But if they own it they have the right to have the people they want working for them. ","1538978830"
"cupcakesarethedevil","cupcakesarethedevil","Well that's how the law works racial and sex employment discrimination is illegal, while you can definitely discrimate against someone for being trans, their political views or the car they drive.","1538980262"
"ghatty09","ghatty09","I still think if the owner wants to discriminate racially or sexually they can, I just personally would not. ","1538980579"
"cupcakesarethedevil","cupcakesarethedevil","What if I came to an agreement with everyone in my small town that if no one discriminates against me because of my race  then I won't discrimate against them?","1538981418"
"ghatty09","ghatty09","Then good for you and your community. I feel like you think im advocating for discrimination everywhere and that it needs to happen. Im simply saying its okay if the business owner does want to. ","1538981541"
"cupcakesarethedevil","cupcakesarethedevil","So as a town then it would be okay if we discriminated against the person breaking our agreement?","1538982013"
"ghatty09","ghatty09","Yes but i think i see where you might try to go with this. You can’t in turn discriminate against them by sending them to jail or making a law about it unless you wanna go with towns being able to jail people for being black, asian, gay, dog people, whatever. You may have the private agreement between private owners. ","1538982543"
"cupcakesarethedevil","cupcakesarethedevil","I'm fine with that being allowed. There's this one town called USA that's really great because from one end of town to the other there are pretty much the same sort of rules so it doesn't get confusing because they don't change much. ","1538983158"
