"[deleted]","[deleted]","There might be a lot of things you do not understand about their relationship. Maybe it is open? Maybe there is a ""don't ask, don't tell"" arrangement? Maybe there is a medical reason? Maybe there are problems in their relationship that is none of your business?

There are too many unknowns for you to make an informed decision. If you had all of that information then maybe it would be ok to rat them out. But without all of the details you are stabbing in the dark.","1483479395"

"ProjectShamrock","ProjectShamrock","I disagree. If I couldn't get it up for some reason and gave my wife permission to sleep with someone else, the last thing I'd want is for some acquaintance to come up and tell me about it. Either I have to be embarrassed by the person thinking poorly of my wife or knowing an embarrassing medical problem of mine.","1483498636"
"WondersaurusRex","WondersaurusRex","That's on your wife for openly talking about your abnormal and remarkable situation in front of people who know you. Not on all of society who should inherently know that if they hear about your wife cheating on you, they shouldn't say anything to you about it because you don't want them to know you know, which is of course a paradox.","1483499508"
"ProjectShamrock","ProjectShamrock","I still don't see how it would be the business of anyone else. What if I converted to Islam and got a second wife? Would it be ok for you to try to infringe on my freedom of religion?","1483499850"
