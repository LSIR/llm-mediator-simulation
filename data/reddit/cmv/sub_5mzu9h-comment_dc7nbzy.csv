"TheChemist158","TheChemist158","Within the law, sure. But we can agree and disagree with certain beliefs. I think see no issue with breaking up with a person over their history. I do see an issue with disparaging a person who does the breaking up. You are of course free to express your belief, but I think it is wrong.","1483999712"

I think that is the point right here:  OP is not just saying that people have the legal right to judge their partners or potential partners over their n-count, but *also* that it is perfectly moral (not shitty) to do so.  If you are going to change their view, you would have to make a case why it *is* morally wrong. ","1484002182"
"neverbeforetherain","neverbeforetherain","I've said nothing about legality or morality. Op is free to make judgement about another person's character based on their actions. I'm also free to do so to OP. What's the problem here?

Op wants to have their cake and eat it too. They want to summarily dismiss others based on past behavior but not be held accountable for there own.","1484002454"
"MMAchica","MMAchica","You still don't seem to be attempting to change OP's view at all.  You haven't made any case as to *why* it would be shitty to judge someone based on their sexual history.  Simply saying that it's shitty isn't in the spirit of CMV.","1484002629"
