"SultanofShit","SultanofShit","A core principle of democracy is ""no taxation without representation"". So, a group denied voting rights should not be taxed. Are you happy for all working women to be exempt from income tax, and yours raised to make up the revenue?","1499255805"
"ImagineQ","ImagineQ","Yes, that would be perfectly acceptable.","1499257162"
"stratys3","stratys3","But this would be unfair to individuals. How is your solution any better than simply letting taxpayers vote - whether they are male or female?

Why group people by sex/gender *at all*? Just use their individual tax returns.","1499257584"
"ImagineQ","ImagineQ","The current system is unfair to Men &amp; unsustainable for society.","1499258160"
"stratys3","stratys3","The current system may be unfair... so why are you trying to replace one unfair system with another unfair system?? That makes no sense.

It would be easier to just use a system that's fair to everyone instead. ","1499258527"
"ImagineQ","ImagineQ","It's not unfair. Women don't fight, don't earn money and don't produce children. And expect to get the same rights as Men?  
That is unfair.","1499259015"
"test_subject6","test_subject6","Women do do all those things. Full stop. ","1499259122"
"ImagineQ","ImagineQ","Women are not required to join the military. No  
Women on average have a negative contribution (They spend more money than they earn)  
The birthrate of most western societies are less than 2.0, so No, women do not produce enough children.","1499259357"
"MeowzorMeowhai","MeowzorMeowhai",">  The birthrate of most western societies are less than 2.0, so No, women do not produce enough children.

You can't put this solely on women. It takes two people (man and woman) to produce children.  If women are failing here, then so are men. ","1499260662"
"ImagineQ","ImagineQ","Yes, I agree.  
Birthrate: Women &amp; Men failing  
Money: Women failing  
Military: Women failing  
There is only 1 category where Men fail, but Women fail all 3 responsibilities of society.  
I wouldn't mind paying extra if I knew babies were being produced and our future secured - however when that is not the case, then I am certainly not funding women.","1499261338"
