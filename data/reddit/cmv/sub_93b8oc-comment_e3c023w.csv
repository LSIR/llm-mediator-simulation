It’s not a bad thing for boys (or girls) to be tough. To be capable and handy and independent. Being encouraged to learn these things is good.

Masculinity becomes toxic when it goes too far. When it comes at the expense of your well-being and happiness, or that of others.","1533010505"
"RarelySayNever","RarelySayNever","i dont believe masculinity can ever come at the expense of a man's happiness or that of others around him

"radialomens","radialomens","Everything is good in moderation. Being able to stick up for yourself is good. But is it also good to be so “tough” that you literally punch anyone who looks at you funny?","1533010962"
"RarelySayNever","RarelySayNever","well men are protectors, theyre supposed to protect their wives and children in the future, how will they be able to do that if they arent physically able to fight? u dont have to punch someone for looking at you funny but what if someone looks at your wife in a sexual manner? youre just going to let that slide huh?","1533011710"
"thedopestshow","thedopestshow","Please clarify what it means to look at something in a sexual manner? ","1533013949"
"RarelySayNever","RarelySayNever","like if someone looks at your wife like he wants to fuck her
