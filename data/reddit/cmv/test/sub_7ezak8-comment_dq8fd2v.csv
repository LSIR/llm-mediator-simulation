"garnet420","garnet420","That's not only an empty argument (because you could say that about speech that is already banned in the US)

It is also irrelevant to what op is saying, because whatever label you choose to put on it, the post is specifically about the ""slippery slope"" argument.","1511442988"
"HydraDragon","HydraDragon","I'm not an American, but what speech is banned in the US?

I guess, because it's not a slippery slope to banning speech, as it is already violating free speech.","1511443334"
"thatoneguy54","thatoneguy54","You can't scream ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater, for example. You can't slander people or commit libel. There are already a ton of restrictions on free speech.","1511444190"
"HydraDragon","HydraDragon","Those are violating other peoples rights though. Libel/slander aims to destroy someone's reputation so they can't function in society to the same extent. Shouting fire in a crowded theatre, when there is no fire, with the aim of inducing panic, and someone gets injured or killed, that is limiting another's rights. If it violates someone else's rights, then it's no longer just speech, but an action.","1511445049"

So does racially abusing someone in many European States. It violates the inviolability of human dignity and many states chose to rule in favor of human dignity over unlimited free speech after the war. ","1511445314"
"HydraDragon","HydraDragon","Dignity is not a right. A right is something that can be taken away, such as religion, speech, movement, private property, etc. In a free society other 'rights' are required, such as a trial and a jury of your peers.","1511445699"
