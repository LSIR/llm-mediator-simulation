"MrSnrub28","MrSnrub28","This sounds unnecessarily restrictive. If two workers speak a common language as their first language what’s the problem with them shooting the shit in their preferred language just because a customer is in earshot?

Customers are not entitled to hearing and understanding every word that escapes a person’s mouth just because they can hear them.","1526582381"
"ReallyLikesRum","ReallyLikesRum","Because they can be doing unsavory things in front of the customer. The reason why I choose a restaurant where I can see into the kitchen is because I know the people aren't going to screw with my food when I'm watching them. If they wanted to plot something in another language I'd be none the wiser and would be able to do it right in front of my face. You're right I'm not entitled to hear but that means I'll just choose another establishment for my own safety. ","1526582587"
"renoops","renoops","Should employees be banned from whispering? Or having conversations in private? Or using jargon? Or comunicating nonverbally? Employees shouldn't do unsavory things. How they communicate with one another is irrelevant.","1526582807"
"ReallyLikesRum","ReallyLikesRum","Yes Yes and Yes. They can do these unsavory things, but if I hear them talking about it at least I can take my business elsewhere. They have less of a chance of doing something bad if they don't have a chance to talk about it when I walk in the door. It is most certainly NOT irrelevant .","1526582953"
"renoops","renoops","So every conversation staff has need to be in the presince of customers, at an audible level, and in plain English with no references to anything the layperson might not understand? How in the world do you imagine this being implemented.","1526583044"
"ReallyLikesRum","ReallyLikesRum","I'm saying when in front of customers, service people should make themselves understood to the general population to a reasonable degree. If server says a word in English I don't understand but the rest of the general population does its my own fault for being stupid then. ","1526583980"
"renoops","renoops","It seems like you're not actually concerned with food safety or being ripped off, then, as this could certainly happen without conversation or via a discussion prior or out of earshot.

It seems like you're just made uncomfortable by people speaking other languages around you, which is another issue entirely and something you should probably investigate and reflect on.","1526584091"
"ReallyLikesRum","ReallyLikesRum","I resent that notion because I practice what I preach. As a trilingual service worker and supervisor I never speak anything other than English in the workplace and expect the people I supervise to do the same. Sounds like you are projecting your feelings.","1526584271"
"Feathring","Feathring","Why are you getting so hostile? People are legitimately trying to challenge these beliefs because they seem irrational.","1526585008"
"ReallyLikesRum","ReallyLikesRum","To me, he was implying that I was xenophobic or racist or something of that sort. Wouldn't you take offense to that? I'm from NYC, I love languages and people speaking them around me. I just want to be able to understand the person serving me food. ","1526585128"
"whiteivy767","whiteivy767","Why is language so important to you in a financial transaction? You are ordering food and giving your money. You don’t even need to talk much.","1526585311"
"ReallyLikesRum","ReallyLikesRum","Because people serving you can steal or harm you by tampering with the product. ","1526585495"
