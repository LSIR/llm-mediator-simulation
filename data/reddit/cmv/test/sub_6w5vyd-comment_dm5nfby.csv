"finfan96","finfan96","Cincinnati is actually a very unusual example. In 2016, its county went 53-43 for Clinton over Trump, BUT, 54-42 for Rob Portman (one dem and one rep) 

In 2014, it went 60-36 for John Kasich (rep)

In 2012, it went 52-45 for Obama, and 53-44 for Sherrod Brown (both dems)

So to claim it consistently votes democrat OR Republican seems like a rough claim. Not necessarily saying you're wrong, but you may need a different example.","1503764503"

Cincinnati only has pockets of neighborhoods that I would consider ""inner-city"" and you would have to analyze those but its a very safe bet considering our data on those groups at large that they vote majority democrat, consistently.

This is a bad definition. I'm going to need a specific brightline. ","1503772256"
