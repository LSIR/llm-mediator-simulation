"theshantanu","theshantanu","I think it would be interesting to know *why* do you have this preference. ","1482841164"
"stellako","stellako","Same reason a heterosexual man prefers women. ","1482842623"
"theshantanu","theshantanu","Which is?","1482842841"
"stellako","stellako","they just do? ","1482843176"
"theshantanu","theshantanu","Why though?","1482843525"
"stellako","stellako","Your guess is as good as mine to be honest ","1482843974"
"theshantanu","theshantanu","So to clarify, you hold a view but you have no idea as to why you hold it? Hate to break it to you OP but that's racist.","1482844342"
"Exnie","Exnie","A) Not a view, a preference. 

B) You like coffee more than tea but don't know why? Sorry, that's racist. ","1482844956"
"theshantanu","theshantanu","Well this is change my view not change my preference, so maybe try somewhere else?I like tea because I don't like the bitterness of coffee, also it gives me acidity. See how I gave reasons for my preference? Maybe OP just can't compute that much.","1482845569"
"Exnie","Exnie","The view is that it's not racist to have that preference.

Why don't you like the bitterness of coffee? You don't know, it's simply your preference. You have no control over what you think tastes good, and OP has no control over what he is attracted to. ","1482845944"
"theshantanu","theshantanu","No, his view is it's not racist to have a specific preference. I gave reasons for why I have a specific preference and so should he. If liking tea more than coffee makes me *teast* then I'd be fine with that. That would be an apt label of my preferences. OP isn't fine with his label so he should elaborate as to why he has that taste.","1482846260"
"Exnie","Exnie","You said the same thing I did...

Racism implies you think one race is superior to another. Being attracted to a race doesn't mean you think it's superior since people are more than just sex objects.","1482846458"
