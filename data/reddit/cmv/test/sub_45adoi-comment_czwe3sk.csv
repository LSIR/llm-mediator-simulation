"blue_dice","blue_dice","Well I'll just focus on one aspect of the post - why do you think 'mansplaining' as a term is baseless? Do you believe that the men the term is applied to don't actually condescend to women?","1455220752"
"_Woodrow_","_Woodrow_","The problem is grouping men as a whole with those that do this behavior (like his examples) ","1455221771"
"InfinitelyThirsting","InfinitelyThirsting","But that's not what the term does, anymore than ""white supremacist"" asserts that all white people are racist.","1455224663"
"_Woodrow_","_Woodrow_","No- white supremacist actually describes someone who thinks whites are supreme compared to other races. It's an accurate description.

Why do you need the term ""mansplaining"" when ""condescending"" means literally the exact same thing? I can only see it as a way to describe a behavior *men* do (indiscriminately) - thus the term. ","1455224807"
"InfinitelyThirsting","InfinitelyThirsting","It doesn't. Mansplaining is a *specific form* of specifically sexist condescension. There's nothing indiscriminate about it. Just because you want to give it your own definition doesn't make you right, any more than if you were to insist that ""schadenfreude"" (which literally means harm-joy, remember) is about, say, cutters who derive joy from harming themselves.","1455225241"
"_Woodrow_","_Woodrow_","Yeah- how irrational of me to think something called *man*splaining is describing something *men* do.

I'm so silly ","1455225365"
"InfinitelyThirsting","InfinitelyThirsting","When the actual definition is repeated over and over to you and you keep throwing a hissy fit, well, yeah. The fact that a man is doing it is not irrelevant, but it's not asserting that all men are condescending.","1455225578"
"_Woodrow_","_Woodrow_","The cognitive dissonance in this thread is so bewildering ","1455226471"
"InfinitelyThirsting","InfinitelyThirsting","Yeah, stubborn victim complexes can be aggravating. Like those ""womyn not women"" types. Amirite?","1455226892"
"_Woodrow_","_Woodrow_","What are you even talking about?

I'm referring to you - your cognitive dissonance. How can you not see it is a slur? A relatively benign slur, but a slur none-the-less. ","1455227349"
"InfinitelyThirsting","InfinitelyThirsting","I know, honey, I was being sarcastic and condescending, because I've outlined how it's not a slur in several different ways and you keep going ""But nuh uh it's got MAN in it so it MUST mean this thing it doesn't actually mean!"", and I'm just tired of beating my head against your wall.","1455229524"
"_Woodrow_","_Woodrow_","Are you womansplaining now? 

Anything else that uses stereotypical attributes of a class of people to describe a behavior is a slur. ""I'm just talking about the bad ones"" isn't a defense of it.
