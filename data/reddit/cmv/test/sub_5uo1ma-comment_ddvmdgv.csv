"Mac223","Mac223",">  religions are key components of human lifestyle

A lot of people live without religion, so I don't see how you can make that claim.","1487364917"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","The claim is not that religions are the key components of everyone's lifestyle.","1487365183"
"Mac223","Mac223",">  When and if humanity does manage to colonize other planets, we should do our best to adapt world religions to space colonization. The reason for this is that religions are key components of human lifestyle.

That's your opening line. I live in a country where it is quite normal to be non-religious, which shows quite clearly that religions are *not* key components of human lifestyle, but entirely optional.","1487367811"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","That's how you're interpreting it, I'm telling you that's not how I mean it.","1487368655"
"Mac223","Mac223","Then I suggest you work on your communication skills because 

 * I'm not the only one in this thread interpreting it that way
 * You still haven't even tried to explain what you actually mean ","1487368811"

The misunderstanding is interpretation of the word ""human"" as ""individual"". I'm using the word to mean ""humanity"" as in a more broad categorization of societies and their works.","1487370096"
"Mac223","Mac223","...that is how I interpreted it. ""Humanity"" gets on just fine where I live without religion.","1487371601"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","You're using humanity to refer to yourself. I'm using it to refer to all of us. It doesn't make sense to drill down into smaller cases","1487371718"
