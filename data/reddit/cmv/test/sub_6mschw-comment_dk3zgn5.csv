"danceinpalemoonlight","danceinpalemoonlight","Off the top of my head, definitely. Said government may be unscrupulous at times, but it contains people with medicine degrees who know what they're talking about. Do you?","1499856038"

"danceinpalemoonlight","danceinpalemoonlight","This is real life, not debate class. Knowing about medicine is relevant when taking medical decisions. You can become qualified too, just study medicine.","1499871863"
"ButtThorn","ButtThorn","Fallacies can serve a purpose in argument in real life. In yours, it does not.

Being able to make an informed medical decision has no relevance to your moral code or ethics.","1499876119"
"danceinpalemoonlight","danceinpalemoonlight","Deciding whether children should be vaccinated or not is not an ethical decision. If it were, the parents would be the only ones qualified to decide.

Whether vaccines are necessary, however, is not an ethical decision. It's a medical one.","1499877594"
"ButtThorn","ButtThorn","Vaccines are irrelevant here. When someone(the government) is given control over your body, they are met with ethical decisions. Decisions you have no reason to trust them with.","1499878145"
"danceinpalemoonlight","danceinpalemoonlight","Vaccines are the point of discussion here. There is no preference or ethics over qualified,  life -of-society decisions. ","1499879489"

Vaccines, poison, water, or whatever doesn't matter, all that matters is the ethics of the entity that you are handing the rights to your body to.","1499880557"

Fuck rights, right? ","1499901907"
"danceinpalemoonlight","danceinpalemoonlight","Fuck cheap, cute little jokes. Vaccines are one of the reasons we can maintain large populations. You are alive to mouth off about your rights because of vaccines, and other evil government plans.","1499925260"
