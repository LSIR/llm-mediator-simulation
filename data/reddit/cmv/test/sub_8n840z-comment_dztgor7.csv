"jfpbookworm","jfpbookworm","It's absolutely a valid response, just not a persuasive one. But what it's saying is that trying to persuade you isn't a priority, especially if you're not trying to educate yourself on the topic. Some topics just have too many sea lions for an ""educational"" response to be worthwhile.","1527683402"
"Buck_Da_Duck","Buck_Da_Duck","The definition google gives me of ""valid"" is ""(of an argument or point) having a sound basis in logic or fact; reasonable or cogent.""

It doesn't meet that criteria.","1527683698"
"jfpbookworm","jfpbookworm","They don't have to debate you no matter how much you'd like them to. They're choosing not to, and that is a valid choice.","1527683875"
"Buck_Da_Duck","Buck_Da_Duck","It's a valid choice to not answer. It's invalid to suggest someone is uneducated because they don't agree with you.","1527684331"
"DHCKris","DHCKris","How do you know you're not uneducated on the subject? If you have an obviously uninformed or bad argument, this response would be completely valid.","1527685176"
"Buck_Da_Duck","Buck_Da_Duck","Being condescending and rude isn't going to lead to the person researching the topic further. Whether I'm educated on the subject or not is irrelevant.","1527685621"
"hammerdeer","hammerdeer","the goal isn't to get you to research the topic further, the goal is to tell you to piss off because you are a lost cause, its perfectly valid lol, people aren't obligated to debate you and you don't, win? or something because they gave a response you don't like.","1527687088"
"TheGreatQuillow","TheGreatQuillow","Who are you too assume someone is a “lost cause?” Maybe if someone took 30 seconds to kindly explain something, they might be open to educating themselves.

If you tell someone to piss off, you are guaranteeing that they see your side of the argument with disdain and derision and they most likely will do no further research. ","1527693849"
