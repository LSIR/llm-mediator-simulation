"ShiningConcepts","ShiningConcepts","But if we are going to control the first civilizations that live on other planets then why can't we just imbue into them our modern, contemporary, and highly rational culture? I mean it's not like they're going to be abandoned and left to form their own culture right?","1487364636"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","Is ""highly rational"" being conflated with atheistic?

The distances and isolation involved with space colonization is going to lead to culture divergence. Religions would be act as a booster to the cultural development of isolated civilizations, civilizations that are isolated like none other before them.","1487365127"
"ShiningConcepts","ShiningConcepts","One question this brings is up is this: what exactly is a religion, and what will a religion offer that a culture cannot? Will we be restarting humanity in those distant colonies? If not, why can't we just imbue the most valuable aspects of our current culture such as technology, reason and fairness (and skip the 1000s of years of hardship that we needed to get to them)?","1487365275"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","I think that's a bad question. Religion is an aspect of culture, and it also propagates it. 

Religion is different than other culture because it is necessarily about deeper truths, philosophy, and morality. The inclusion and preservation of religion does not preclude technology, reason, or fairness.","1487368586"
"Sprezzaturer","Sprezzaturer","Yes it absolutely does. Religion isn't fair in the slightest. If we're talking about christianity, that is. There is very little in the way of deeper truth, zero philosophy, and questionably morality. Christianity is one of the ONLY things that preclude technology and reason, especially right now. In fact, I can't think of one thing that precludes all of those things at once so effectively.","1487369793"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","I don't know where to begin with this. You're conflating religion with a lot of things you're against, to the point it sounds like you're talking about specific people","1487370531"
"Thewilltosucceed","Thewilltosucceed","To be fair, you're conflating religion with a lot of things you're for.","1487375292"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","I make the case for these aspects, and I don't assume necessity.","1487375364"
"Thewilltosucceed","Thewilltosucceed","You literally claim that it's essential to these in another comment.","1487426008"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","Essential in some aspects, but not necessary to benefits","1487430834"
"Thewilltosucceed","Thewilltosucceed","Now you're claiming that it's essential but not necessary. Those words mean the same thing.","1487431359"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","I'm using it for it's definition ""the fundamental aspects""","1487431577"
