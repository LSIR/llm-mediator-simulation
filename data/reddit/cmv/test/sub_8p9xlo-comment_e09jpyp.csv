To part of it i do, through estate taxes. At least thats what the government says. And if it says i have a right to your organs too, then i do.","1528405227"
"TMac1128","TMac1128","That's the controversy of the death tax. You DON'T have a right, because it's already been taxed. The death tax is a double tax. It's also immoral because it's my savings that belongs to me and my family. There is no tax on savings. It also states that the government owns me, when it doesn't.

You either believe in the idea that you own yourself, or the government owns you. If the government owns you then, currently, Donald Trump owns you.","1528405697"
"ElysiX","ElysiX","What do you think ownership is but the group in power agreeing and enforcing that you own something? Doesn't matter that you believe you own yourself when they put you in chains. 

Donald Trump doesnt own me because Im not in the US and the army/government of my coutnry says that I own myself.","1528406212"

"ElysiX","ElysiX","If they have the legitimization of the army and the people, yes.

But we are not talking about them taking your organs when you are alive here.

We are talking about them taking your organs when you are dead, and only if you never said that you don't want that. So why is that scenario wrong, not those other scenarios? ","1528442225"
