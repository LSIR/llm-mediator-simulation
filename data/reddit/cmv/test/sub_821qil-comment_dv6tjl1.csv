The electoral college is the solution to the problem of majority rule.

Wonder why that is a problem that needs a solution?

Imagine 2 wolves and a lamb voting to determine what to eat for dinner.

The electoral college protects against minority oppression by the majority.","1520209040"

The solution to tyranny of the majority is not randomly give the minority more votes. That just lets the minority participate in the tyranny.

The solution is checks and balances. Bicameral legislature, judicial review, veto power, the filibuster, impeachment power -- these all protect against the tyranny of the majority. Randomly increasing a minority's power does not.","1520210344"

Well, I imagine with a nonsensical world-view, arriving at nonsensical answers like abolishing the electoral college would make ""sense"".

In the real world it serves it's purpose perfectly, at least it has to date.","1520219202"
"BrotherItsInTheDrum","BrotherItsInTheDrum","*You're* the one that brought up the wolf and sheep analogy ...

In the electoral college, Wyoming residents' votes count *more* than 3 times as much as Californians'.

Your analogy makes the assumption that Californians are the wolves and Wyomingans are the sheep. What reason is there to think it isn't the other way around?","1520220219"
"ClippinWings451","ClippinWings451","because ""californians"" in this case are simply Californians who live in LA and SF... geographicly the majority of the state is conservative.

With voter turnout as it is... only about 65 million votes are needed to win the election in a straight popular vote...

Do you really believe that 7 large metro areas, (the big angry wolves) should decide every election? The other 19,300 or so cities and towns, (the small weak sheep) be damned?","1520224561"
"Chackoony","Chackoony","Why are Californians the ones who live in LA and SF? Those cities have 5 out of the 40 million people who live in California.  
How did you determine that a geographic majority of California is conservative?  
I believe you're assuming that with lower voter turnout, metro voters have greater impact on elections - why is that?  
Why would the metros decide every election?

What do you think the Blue areas in that map are?","1520262049"

Actually, I don't think you do.","1520515588"
