"cupcakesarethedevil","cupcakesarethedevil","I'm having a difficult time separating what's hyperbole in your view and what your actual view is. We have history books that remember countries that no longer exist thousands of years ago, it's ridiculous to say Japan will be forgotten in less than a decade.

Can you try and state your thesis in a sentence or two?

It's clear you don't like Japan, but what specifically do you want us to change your mind about?","1509299581"
"WehOfTheGod","WehOfTheGod","I actually like Japan.

My thesis is that the country is not in its Golden Age which ended in the 1990s but now in the dark ages.","1509299731"
"cupcakesarethedevil","cupcakesarethedevil","And how would you define golden age and what is your evidence that supports that?","1509299817"
"WehOfTheGod","WehOfTheGod","Japan's GDP growth patterns and its slow population aging. 

Obviously they have screwed up very bad and are now paying the price","1509299985"
"cupcakesarethedevil","cupcakesarethedevil","So Rwanda, Tanzania, and Mozambique are in their golden ages because they have about  7% annual gdp growth and the average woman has 5 kids?","1509300751"
"WehOfTheGod","WehOfTheGod","I meant India and China which are much larger and will create the second Renaissance ","1509301405"
"throwaway_FTH_","throwaway_FTH_","That has nothing to do with Japan being forgotten. How do you know Japan won't have some hand in this supposed ""Renaissance""? Japanese culture has strongly influenced China, for example. Do you even know what you're talking about.","1509309255"
"WehOfTheGod","WehOfTheGod","Hah!

Japan take part in the Asian Renaissance?

Hell will freeze over first. ","1509309830"
