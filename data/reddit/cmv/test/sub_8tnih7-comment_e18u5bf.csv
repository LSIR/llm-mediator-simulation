"DeleteriousEuphuism","DeleteriousEuphuism","It normalizes other sexualities by reframing the [overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window). The idea is that if more eccentric gays can be out and proud then someone who's in the closet will be encouraged to be out as well. In a way, it's similar to [decoy pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing_strategies#Decoy_pricing).","1529899072"

Who. The. Fuck. Cares.

Kid probably thought it was hilarious and now he's more well adjusted to how the world works and won't clutch his pearls at the mere thought of weird shit.

Methinks you could do with seeing some wrinkly old man balls once in a while.","1529955785"

Kid doesn't appear to be laughing or enjoying being subjected to this man's sexuality. The fact that you think little boys enjoy men's penises raises a lot of red flags and questions about you.","1529956598"
