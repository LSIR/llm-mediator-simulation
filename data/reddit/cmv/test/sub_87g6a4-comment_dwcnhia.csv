The strictest form of gun control you're ever even possibly going to see would be a major gun buyback ie: Australia. 

So yeah, I guess we cant disprove you that an impossible thing that will never happen is impossible. ","1522131673"

You mean mandatory confiscation? America has more gun owners than all of Australia's population, so how would that work?

no? literally the exact opposite lmao. 

Its the government buying back guns from citizens.

feel free to read up on this, and how huge a success it was in reducing gun crime

edit: It wouldnt be exactly the same, it would obviously be different due to population but with targeted areas you could get a lot of good done","1522132448"
"SultanofShit","SultanofShit","yeah but we were willing to do that to prevent another mass killing, all evidence shows that Americans are not.","1522132577"
"Wolfe244","Wolfe244","have we tried financial incentive? No, and It would 100% work to at least some degree","1522132791"

"xiccit","xiccit","What part of ""non mandatory gun buy back program"" can't you get through your skull?

When people are offered a decent cash incentive to freely give up arms, they tend to do so. It's not mandatory, it's not a law, and there's no way it would increase gun violence. ","1522135805"

how does that have any bearing on this conversation?

That is not what Australia did... YOU WERE FORCED TO TURN OVER YOU GUNS IN AUSTRALIA! nothing about Australias gun policy was nonmandatory.  

And if you didn't they went door to door...

"anoiing","anoiing","So how many of the 330 million guns would gun owners willing turn in?  1%, 10%... How would that solve any issue, when 80% of all gun crime is committed by gang, who already have amnesty if they turn over their guns, and that has worked so blatantly well in inner cities /s...
