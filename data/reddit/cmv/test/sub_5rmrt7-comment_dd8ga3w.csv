"abutthole","abutthole","The majority of votes in the country were against him and he reached 50% disapproval in 8 days.  Literally the fastest any president has gotten to that point in history.  George W. Bush is generally regarded as a bad president and it took him 3 years to get to a level of disapproval that Trump achieved in 8 days.","1486046800"

"abutthole","abutthole","Then those weren't votes.  You're also wrong.  55.3% of voters turned out to vote.  Of those, 45.6% voted for Trump, 48% voted for Clinton, and the rest were 3rd party or write-in. ","1486057082"

That's right! It's 45% who didn't vote!","1486057588"
