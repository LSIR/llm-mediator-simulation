Cool. Why are we paying them all equally? ","1508444398"

"Milskidasith","Milskidasith","Alright, so why specifically are you against slacker humanities students and not slacker bio majors or future engineers?","1508448420"
"JoannaNewsomFan","JoannaNewsomFan","I'm sure that a lot of what I wrote out applies to slacker bio majors as well. From what I understand, engineering is a more difficult program, and graduating with C's requires significantly more effort than achieving the same grades in English lit, for example. I'm also not totally sure, but I think engineering graduates are, on average, better poised to provide value to the taxpayers that funded their education than are art history graduates.

"UncleMeat11","UncleMeat11","I'm a PhD in CS. My partner is a PhD in history. I want you to guess how much each of us read for our qualifying exams.

I read three textbooks and about 20 papers.

My partner read 250 books.

Are you sure you are properly understanding the relative difficulty?","1508451873"
