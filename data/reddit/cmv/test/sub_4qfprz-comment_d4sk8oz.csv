"jansencheng","jansencheng","It's because it demeans LGBT Pride Day. LGBTs were a, until recently, opposed group, and they celebrate that they achieved that one small victory.

Heterosexuals on the other hand, have never been oppressed, and don't have anything to celebrate.

But while we do, celebrating the status quo will only be, at best, a mockery. Celebrating LGBT pride also serves to raise awareness about an issue, celebrating heterosexuality only serves to divert attention away from a genuine problem","1467213182"
