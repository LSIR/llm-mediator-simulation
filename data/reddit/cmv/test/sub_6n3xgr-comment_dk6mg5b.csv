"bearDTA","bearDTA","I have doubts in whether or not people of different races can coexist together. I do not believe they can but that view is not as strong as other ","1499978829"

"Shaky_Balance","Shaky_Balance","To paraphrase [yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6n3xgr/cmv_i_agree_with_richard_spencer_and_would/dk6qqq5):

""Oh yeah a few people not coexisting means nobody can, I get it.""

You'll find being less hand-wavy and more respectful will produce better conversation in thus sub.

Also the millions upon millions of people coexisting should vastly outweigh the thousands of people not coexisting.","1499984474"
"bearDTA","bearDTA","I deleted that comment because, yes I see that it was rude.

Also you say millions upon millions of people are coexisting but in America if you talk to black people about race and the police Im sure the majority will tell you all about the racial tensions that they face and instances that they have encountered racism. Even our past election was extremely intense because of issues with race and racism. I wouldn't call that coexisting.","1499985400"
