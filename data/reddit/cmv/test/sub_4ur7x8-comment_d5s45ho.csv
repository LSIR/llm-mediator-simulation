"PreacherJudge","PreacherJudge","The only third party that I can potentially see a cynical republican and a cynical democrat both agreeing to vote for is the libertarian party (assuming the cynical democrat is not actually very left-wing and the republican is not religious).  The idea that American politics would be bolstered by the rise of the libertarian party is one I do not personally believe and in any case requires far more justification.","1469570777"

Edit: After thinking it through.... what if the particular candidate wasn't an issue. What if both sides only had to agree not to vote for one of the two major party candidates?","1469570936"
"PreacherJudge","PreacherJudge","The green party's platform goes against everything US conservatives tend to stand for.  It's much more of a longshot than a democrat going libertarian, especially if the democrat isn't that liberal in the first place.

EDIT: The potential gain you suggest is the rise of a third party.  If the votes are just cast willy-nilly, there's no chance of any given party getting enough votes to be noteworthy.","1469571124"

Do you know anything about Libertarians? They're anarchists.

Once they start booing the civil rights act you'll know how absurd yours statement is","1469591214"

It's anarchy

All real* libertarians do is rebrand anarchy","1469601792"

"Ashoka345","Ashoka345","No that's not what a libertarian is, that's what a conservative is

At the least a libertarian wants to do away with everything the federal government has done since reconstruction, which isn't really a libertarian position philosophically. But there is a strong legal argument behind this line of reasoning. 

taking it back ""a notch"" would not include overturning the civil rights act or letting slavery return to the south.
