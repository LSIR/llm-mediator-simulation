OP, 500 people is a lot of people.","1497202332"
"N8Roberts","N8Roberts","In a county of over 3 million people, it's really not. In fact it's about .0001% of the population. I know that they're still people with lives and loved ones, but in the world we live in we can't get caught up in a tiny percentage like that. ","1497202810"
"sarcasmandsocialism","sarcasmandsocialism","We spend millions, if not billions of dollars fighting terrorism and that kills far fewer people than assault rifles.  We have incredibly strict regulations restricting refugees from coming here, even though refugees don't kill Americans.  If we're willing to restrict children fleeing wars in the name of public safety, why not restrict access to guns that kill hundreds of Americans *every year*?","1497210759"
"Geralt_of_Rivia1","Geralt_of_Rivia1","Terrorism has killed less than 3 people in US history? Because assault rifles have only killed 3 people in US history. I am pretty sure 9/11 alone killed 3000","1497214093"
"sarcasmandsocialism","sarcasmandsocialism","There is no point in using such a narrow definition of assault weapons to try to avoid discussing gun control.  Semantics aside, using the OP's statistics the 3000 deaths from 9/11 is insignificant compared to the approximately 150,000 firearms murders in the US since then.","1497216304"

"sarcasmandsocialism","sarcasmandsocialism","I also can't define cancer, but that doesn't mean we should ignore it. We regulate *tons* of things I'm not an expert on. As a citizen I'm supposed to share goals and broad opinions with my legislators. Congress and regulative agencies are supposed to work out the details and have hearings so the public can comment if they think they left in a loophole or if the restrictions are too strict.","1497221304"
"sanchostache","sanchostache","This whole thread is about assault weapons and you can't even define what an assault weapon is. What are you doing here?","1497223491"
"sarcasmandsocialism","sarcasmandsocialism","This thread is about thousands of people who have been killed by guns and you want to argue semantics instead of substance? Why?","1497224295"
