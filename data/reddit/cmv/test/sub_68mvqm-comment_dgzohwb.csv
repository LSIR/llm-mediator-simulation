"Mitoza","Mitoza","Accepting differing sexualities exist and that transgender people exist is not an extreme leftist political agenda. It makes perfect sense for Bill Nye to affirm this. You may disagree with it, but that doesn't make it propaganda.","1493656925"
"Marsh7579","Marsh7579","I should clarify my view on that issue. I am actually a very liber**tarian** person. As far as I'm concerned, people can be and do whatever they choose so long as they aren't hurting anybody. The problem I have with that song is the way that it's dogmatically presented as gospel truth without any kind of argument. Bill even says at the end ""that's exactly the right message"". I'll add an edit to the op to clarify this.","1493659586"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","That wasn't your criticism. You had criticized its ""political agenda"". Do you recant that?

You're looking in the wrong place if you want a debate. This is Bill Nye's TV show. Even if he did have a debate between people on the issue, he is presenting an editorialization that portrays a certain message. Bill is not obligated to make the position of science vs. anti-science a debate, as that would only serve to falsely inflate the other side as if it had any merit. ","1493660021"
"Slenderpman","Slenderpman","I disagree with you on OP's argument. I don't agree that the show is propaganda, but I do think OP is right that he does not criticize Nye's political stance but instead dislikes how Bill seems to ignore any argument that disagrees with his understanding.","1493662863"
"Mitoza","Mitoza","This is a quote from OP:

> seems nothing more than a heavyhanded extreme leftist political agenda that ridicules and silences dissenting voices.

In this sense, transgender acceptance is a ""leftist political agenda"". ","1493663257"
"Slenderpman","Slenderpman","Right but contextually he's criticizing their heavy handedness and silencing of dissent not their left leaning views","1493669584"
"Mitoza","Mitoza",">  My criticism is that he sees fit to push a political agenda. The ideas themself are less than perfect, but I could let that slide if he treated the subject matter with evenhandedness and respect.

That is a quote from OP in another thread with me. He is still conflating acceptance of transgender individuals as a ""political agenda"". I'm challenging that notion. Your and my conversation isn't that useful, so goodbye. ","1493669711"
