What is your opinion on people who have tried to commit suicide? Should we not help them aswell?","1530888850"
"TheGre-ahGood","TheGre-ahGood","That is typically mental illness which is not self-inflicted. Let's not confuse knowingly physically harming yourself with known harmful substances with having a mental illness that leads you to contemplate harming yourself.","1530889270"
"bad_luck_charm","bad_luck_charm","Addiction is typically described as a disease. How is that different?","1530889461"
"TheGre-ahGood","TheGre-ahGood","I never heard of a disease that makes you addicted to something you've never tried before. Can you explain how an addictive person becomes addicted to heroin before they've tried it?","1530889922"
"bad_luck_charm","bad_luck_charm","Ever been prescribed painkillers by a doctor?","1530890279"
"TheGre-ahGood","TheGre-ahGood","You are responsible for what enters your body. No one else is. If you are not informed about what you are ingesting, you are the one that suffers the consequences.","1530890337"
"bad_luck_charm","bad_luck_charm","Your argument is that people should disobey the advice of their doctors on pain of death? That seems rather extreme.","1530890711"
"TheGre-ahGood","TheGre-ahGood","Life is unfortunately not fair. Some people have bad lives, others have good lives and everywhere in between. Knowing that doctors and the pharmaceutical industry are in bed together. Especially with opiod prescriptions that are knowingly addictive. You would be a fool to blindly follow the advice of any person trying to push that on you.","1530891190"
"bad_luck_charm","bad_luck_charm","You realize that your argument is:

""Oh, that guy was in extreme pain for a medical condition and accepted that vicodin prescription. Should've known better though. Let 'im die.""","1530891496"
"TheGre-ahGood","TheGre-ahGood","He wouldn't die from the pain. That's your argument then, right? If you doesn't have the vicodin he dies... I know that's not really your argument, but that is how it is presented.

Opiods are bad and can very negatively impact your life. If you ignore that information then you are responsible.","1530891753"
"bad_luck_charm","bad_luck_charm","No. My argument is that addiction is a disease and you can be set on the path of addiction through no fault of your own. 

*Your* position is that anyone who winds up addicted to opioids should be allowed to die.","1530891863"
