"DarthLeon2","DarthLeon2","How about the conversations that can't even be had because the very act of bringing them up is considered bigoted? Are men and women fundamentally different? Sexist against women. ","1530990979"
"vbob99","vbob99","Were you just prevented from saying that by the government?   If not, seems there is no problem.

If you want to control how people react to what you say, it seems you are the one trying to censor speech and actions.","1530996416"
"DarthLeon2","DarthLeon2",">  If you want to control how people react to what you say, it seems you are the one trying to censor speech and actions.

I don't want to control them. I want them to act like adults and not children. Political correctness is ultimately about attitude, and the attitude of ""I don't want to ever hear anything I think is unpleasant"" is the attitude of a child. ","1530996876"
"vbob99","vbob99","How is having a reaction to what you say any of those things?  You can legally say whatever you want, but people also are free to react as they do.
