Plenty of health issues, injuries or medical conditions arenâ€™t immediately visible to the casual eye.  The obesity could be entirely unrelated to the root cause of that individual getting a handicap permit. ","1519835360"

"clown-penisdotfart","clown-penisdotfart","Yes! This is it! This is why losing weight is simple. You are tasked with simply eating less.  You don't need to go run 8 miles a day, though it will improve your health and fitness. All you have to do to lose weight is eat fucking less.","1519854512"

"Tinie_Snipah","Tinie_Snipah","And yet hundreds of thousands of people quit smoking every year, and that is a serious drug that controls a lot of your brain. Help exists for weight loss, it's a lack of motivation that stops people losing weight","1519857232"
"Lunardose","Lunardose","Yeah but food is literally necessary for survival. You can go you're whole life without doing drugs. Or half on and half off. 

You can't do that with food, in fact you literally must eat. It's not fair, or correct, to compare these two things.","1519860138"
"Tinie_Snipah","Tinie_Snipah","How is that relevant though? What you said isn't wrong, but something being necessary for your survival doesn't mean you are forced to consume too much of it. You're stating a fact but it doesn't actually address what I said

Everyone can eat less to lose weight. Some may need more motivation and external help, but weight loss is really simple.","1519861848"
