"sillybonobo","sillybonobo","The only part of your post I'd disagree with is the ""has become"" part. The anti SJW movement *began* as a bigoted moment of reactionaries unwilling to examine their engrained practices. 

There are some moderates who got annoyed by nitpicking criticism, but the ""movement"" was created and led by bigots in an effort to silence all social criticism. Unfortunately, they have succeeded, and ANY amount of political or social commentary provokes a huge backlash.","1442075343"

Sure there were some people who just wanted to rage against minorities and stuff but now it seems like those people have become the majority.

"WizardofStaz","WizardofStaz","You targeted those people because you were ignorant and afraid of women. As you learned more about the context of both feminism and the opposing social movement, you realized what a pack of wolves you were really running with.","1442078168"
"timant321","timant321","Um no. The majority of my friends have always been women, during my childhood I was raised primarily by my mother and grandmother, I find it easier to talk to women than other men. There was never a point in my life  when I was ""ignorant and afraid of women"". Don't patronize me.","1442080133"
"WizardofStaz","WizardofStaz","Oh, if you have female friends, that means you understand women. Sure. That's how it works. That's why none of my male friends have ever said ridiculously insulting misogynist things to me! Oh wait, yes, they have. Stop thinking you're immune to ignorance or prejudice.","1442082502"
"timant321","timant321","You are the type of person that led to the backlash against SJWs. Stop thinking you somehow know what goes on in peoples heads.","1442082893"
