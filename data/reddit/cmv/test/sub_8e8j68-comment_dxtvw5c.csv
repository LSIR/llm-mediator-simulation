"ThreeTokes","ThreeTokes","What about people like me? I checked organ donor on the paperwork, but its not on my license. (WTF?) And my organs are beat to shit anyway so I might be signed up, but they wont be able to take shit. Do I get organs if I need them?","1524493451"
"DrZack","DrZack","I should have clarified- it should be:

1) Opt-out rather than opt-in

2) Willingness to donate is what determines eligibility. Many people think they can't donate organs but really are candidates. Let the doctors decide if your organs are able to be used. ","1524493624"
"ThreeTokes","ThreeTokes","But like I said, I checked the box to donate, but they fucked up and didn't put it on my license. Under your theory, anyone without ORGAN DONOR on their license doesn't deserve a new heart. I wouldn't get good organs because the fat bitch at the DMV didnt do her job. On this point alone, your whole stance is invalid to me.","1524494280"
"DrZack","DrZack","No, anyone who actively withdrawls from the ""organ donation/transplantation program"" would be ineligible. That is a huge difference. The assumption is that everyone participates unless they explicitly say otherwise. I changed my view on ""opt-in"" vs ""opt-out"" system in another post. ","1524494432"
"ThreeTokes","ThreeTokes","And due to some technical glitch or some fat bitch messing up paperwork, people who never opted out would be listed as opted out somehow, thus being refused the organs they need to live. Your whole CMV is about denying people medical treatment, which is a terrible idea when so many people suck at their job and things don't work properly 100% of the time. I'm not in the business of telling people they aren't worthy of proper medical treatment, regardless of what they do with their own organs.","1524496053"
"DrZack","DrZack","You're argument is based on practicalities, not ethical underpinnings. The argument that this would be hard to implement with 100% accuracy is almost certainly true, but does not invalidate my point.

In addition, organ transplantation is rarely a true emergency (of course it's time limited, but not like a ruptured aortic aneurysm). You would have time to figure out any previous problems with the database.","1524496248"
