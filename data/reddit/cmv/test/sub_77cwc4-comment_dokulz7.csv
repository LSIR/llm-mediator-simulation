"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","Blacks are always the perpetrators of crime, especially in integrated places.

You do understand that your sentence won't hold to the smallest level of examination. 

White people do commit crime. If that is true, and it is, your idea doesn't really work.

"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","Yes, your sentence still doesn't hold. 

once I find an example of a white person killing someone, which I can., your idea that black people are the only ones who do that type of thing fails. 

Most white victims of violent crime are harmed by other white people. ","1508399359"
"ReinhardVonLoengram","ReinhardVonLoengram","Strawman argument. No one said they are the only ones. However, relative to their population , it's far higher per capita , which is why it's a huge problem. A couple million blacks are killing as much and sometimes even more than hundreds of millions of whites . ","1508400212"

You did. 

It was the first sentence of your view. 

The first one. 

You can't start with a statement of ""This group always does this thing.....and then shy away from it. ","1508400340"
"ReinhardVonLoengram","ReinhardVonLoengram","No, you're just nit picking. If i said ""i always go to mcdonalds"" it doesn't mean that i exclusively go to mcdonalds. It means that i go there a lot relative to other places. Likewise , blacks commit far more crime relative to anyone else. ","1508400795"
"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","Words matter in these or they don't. 

You can't make a strong statement like you did and then shy away from it. 

own your words. Or edit your post. But you don't get it both ways. You can't make a strong statement and then walk away from it when people call you on that statement. 

If you do that this just becomes a game of me chasing the goal posts. ","1508401193"
"ReinhardVonLoengram","ReinhardVonLoengram","Im not shying away from anything. I stand by the statement since it's not what you are interpreting it differently to begin with. Either keep nit picking or leave. ","1508402906"
"Iswallowedafly","Iswallowedafly","This is pointless then. 

You can't say that your opening line doesn't matter. That kind of defeats the purpose of this sub. 

You make a line in the sand and defend it. You don't get to move that line any time you want to. ","1508403141"
"ReinhardVonLoengram","ReinhardVonLoengram","I didn't move anything. The opening line still stands. But keep nit picking after ive stated it doesnt mean what you think it does. A false interpretation  is your problem, not mines. ","1508403504"
"Smudge777","Smudge777","If many, many people are all having the same ""false interpretation"", then it's not a problem with the interpretation, it's a problem with the communicator.  

You're using the word ""always"" to mean ""not always"" then blaming others for misinterpreting.","1508410907"
