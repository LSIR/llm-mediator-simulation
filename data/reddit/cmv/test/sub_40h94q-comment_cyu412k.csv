"IceRollMenu2","IceRollMenu2","Definition of veganism from the people who invented the word:

> Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

Veganism is practicable by definition. If you can't survive without eating other people or animals, you count as vegan so long as you reduce your exploitation to the absolutely necessary minimum.","1452527428"
"BreatheCarolina11","BreatheCarolina11","Yeah, but definitions change.","1452528332"
"IceRollMenu2","IceRollMenu2","Not this one. It's the definition endorsed by actual vegans and it's also the first thing in the sidebar of /r/vegan. Have you looked into this issue at all before?

This definition also nicely highlights the fact that other people's inability to eat the very same things as you does not count as a cheap excuse not to go vegan yourself. You're vegan if you do your best to avoid animal exploitation, simple. And doing your best is by definition doable.","1452531293"
