"skwishy29","skwishy29","She’s clearly not giving consent in that example.  You have to actually say “yea I’m good with that”. If you think saying nothing is consent, then I guess raping someone who is unable to speak is ok? 
And regardless of the child thing, if someone whipped it out in public it would be sexual assault","1528720118"
"BillChristbaws","BillChristbaws","Yes, raping someone who is unable to speak is 100% ok, that is my view. 

Lets keep it in a less ridiculous realm shall we? 

How many times have you kissed someone without them giving vocal consent? Then moved onto something overtly sexual without vocal consent? ","1528720492"
"skwishy29","skwishy29","I wasn’t accusing you of actually thinking rape is ok, I was saying they follow the same logic.
When you kiss someone you are already in a relationship with consent is implied, just like if you are married, you can initiate sex without being a rapist. In a relationship where they have had sex before there was clearly implied consent. 
But in this example there was no implied consent at all, he just randomly tried to initiate something that he has no reason to think was consented ","1528724977"
