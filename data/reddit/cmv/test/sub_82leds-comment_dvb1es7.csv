If I don’t believe in God I will become an outcast in my society. I want to remain part of my society so I believe in God. ","1520397572"
"Canvasch","Canvasch","Kind of works but only under conditions that aren't relevant to OP's question. Also if anything that's a reason to pretend you believe if you don't, not a reason to believe in its own. ","1520405657"

"Canvasch","Canvasch","That just isn't how it works. You can't choose what to believe. If you legitimately don't believe in God, social pressure wouldn't change those beliefs, just make you keep them to yourself. ","1520406665"

No you REALLY can't.

Prove it. 

&lt;Like what?

"Electrivire","Electrivire","Do you also not understand the burden of proof? 

Because you said someone can choose what they believe. I pointed out that isn't the case because it hasn't been demonstrated. 

> Does God exist

There is no conflicting evidence there. There is no evidence one exists. Period.

Yes and you have not satisfied it.    Because you said someone can’t choose what they believe. I pointed out that isn't the case b it hasnn't been demonstrated. 


&lt;There is no conflicting evidence there. There is no evidence one exists. Period.
