The power dynamic between workers and employers is a defining feature of what capitalism is. You need to realize a lot of what you call ""society"" is just different aspects of the ideology of capitalism. Saying something is ""society"" but not capitalism just sounds like you're a fish that doesn't know what water is, even though you live in it.","1504073852"
"SavannaJeff","SavannaJeff","And the power dynamic in communism is the party members on one side, and everyone else on the other. The people in the sub aren't criticizing the worker/employer dynamic, they're criticizing weird bullshit which isn't inherent to capitalism. ","1504073950"
