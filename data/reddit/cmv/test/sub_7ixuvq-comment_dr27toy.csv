"RebelMillenial95","RebelMillenial95","Yeah I guess. You are either male or female. If you're female and think you're a man, you're still a female and vice versa ","1512950332"
"TurtleOnTheRocks","TurtleOnTheRocks","So no you do not believe that trans men are men. I would start by pointing out that trans people have always existed and that many trans men's (physically born women) brains do not naturally run on estrogen but rather testosterone and vice versa","1512951168"
"mouthpanties","mouthpanties","But aren't you still a man with an abnormal brain, not a woman. ","1512952486"
"Odysseus1984","Odysseus1984","How do you determine normal traits vs abnormal traits? Is it just percentage wise? If a trait is uncommon does that make it abnormal?","1512960444"
"mouthpanties","mouthpanties","Isn't that the definition of abnormal, that it is uncommon? 

Its normal for a woman (xx) to have a vagina and a man (xy) to have a penis. I believe those are the traits in question.
