To demean human life as you have done is not acceptable and is extremely insulting. It is very anti semitic as well. ","1468392561"
"yeahmaaaaaaaaaaaaate","yeahmaaaaaaaaaaaaate","If intelligence is the metric that defines the worth of a creature and intelligence is hypothetically infinite , it is entirely logical to envision the existence of a being to whom we are ""not fully sentient"".

Is it moral for that creature to enslave and abuse you, since it is so much more intelligent than you?","1468393439"
"cdb03b","cdb03b","If we evolved on the same planet and they were natural predators of us yes it would be moral. 

Edit: We are naturally omnivores and naturally predators. We raise animals giving them safer, better fed lives with shelter and then kill them extremely quickly. All of that is better than they would get in the wild. Even factory farming is (most of the time) a better life than they would have in the wild. To compare that to the holocaust is insulting.

what if they werent our natural predators and didnt need us to survive? what if they just liked the way we tasted and didnt need to torture us but did it anyway because they didnt give a fuck about us?

"cdb03b","cdb03b","What if they did? That is not the situation you are talking about with factory farming. We are the natural predators of those animals. So much so that many of them would not exist without us. ","1468394550"

What is a ""natural predator""? How can we call ourselves ""natural predators"" if the animals we eat if virtually 100% of the meat we eat is not hunted at all, and especially not by us?

> So much so that many of them would not exist without us.

That doesnt make any sense.

A lion is a natural predator to a gazelle. If lions didnt eat gazelles, there would be *more* gazelles.","1468395801"
"PointyBagels","PointyBagels","If lions had access to our level technology, do you think they wouldn't use it to make their hunting more efficient, possibly to the point of breeding gazelles like we do cows/chickens/pigs?

Of course they would.  Technology is not a reason to disqualify humans from being natural predators.","1468397140"
