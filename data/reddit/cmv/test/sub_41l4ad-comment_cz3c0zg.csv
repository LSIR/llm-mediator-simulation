Banning people who pose a threat to the nation discovered by vetting them is a good thing and something that every country does, but banning them only for their religion is not acceptable. ","1453162178"

Atheists still can't hold office in about half the US. God is on all of our money and the pledge that kids sing every day for 13 years.","1453162683"
"cdb03b","cdb03b","The pledge is not sung. It is recited, and it is generally not recited after elementary school, so you are looking at 6 years not 13. ","1453219859"
"Parkerwr03","Parkerwr03","I can't believe you are arguing whether or not it is sung. Choice wording, its rhythmic. Also, it is 13 years. It is recited in every school every day from elementary to high school. Check your facts, its one google away.","1453239395"

You really hate being wrong don't you?","1453244671"
"Parkerwr03","Parkerwr03","Schools are supposed. Every school. Every day. But they don't have to. If a district wants to change it for their area, they can. It's called bureaucracy. Now how do I mute you? There's no button on your profile","1453244782"
"SC803","SC803","8 states have no law requiring it or encouraging it

Even by you're own response if they are ""supposed"" to then they would. The word you're looking for is encouraged.
