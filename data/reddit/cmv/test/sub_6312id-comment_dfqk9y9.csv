Edit: people, people! I honestly dont care anymore","1491159651"
"NoSirAllThirteen13","NoSirAllThirteen13","What makes you think women don't feel attracted and aroused by the ripped upper body of a man? ","1491159725"
"911isaconspiracy","911isaconspiracy","It doesn't matter, they don't have protruding boners to hide. 

I'm not even saying women shouldn't go topless. They can do whatever they want. But I don't see how normalizing nudity will remove attraction. The day men and women no longer need each other to get off or reproduce is the day nudity won't be a big deal.

Also we've come too far as a race to go back to being naked. It doesn't make sense at all evolution-wise. ","1491160066"
"NoSirAllThirteen13","NoSirAllThirteen13","Again, breasts themselves are not related directly to nudity.

And as for your final statement, it used to be illegal for men to be shirtless in public as well in the US, because society at the time considered it improper and even some considered it a form of nudity.

It wasn't until the 20th century until it was socially ok for men to be shirtless.","1491160751"
"911isaconspiracy","911isaconspiracy","Tell me how you would implement making it okay for women to be topless in areas where men can be topless? I'm legitimately asking. What's your plan?

"NoSirAllThirteen13","NoSirAllThirteen13","I never said I was going to implement it.

I merely said it's a stupid law and women should be allowed to.

In order for it to become acceptable, society must first evolve so those who follow society come to accept it as well.","1491161249"
