"tumadre22","tumadre22","It does.  If you're not an ethnic Norse it does matter.  Different ethnicities have different height averages.  


But shorter Scandinavians aren't that rare either.  Ever seen Lars Ulrich (Danish musician from Metallica) or Björn Ulvaeus (Swedish musician from ABBA)? They are shorter than the average Scandinavian: Lars is about 1.67m and Björn is about 1.78m, making them both below the average of the Scandinavian media of 1.82m.","1535419110"
"Josef_t","Josef_t","you are comparing rich celebs to that of an average guy like me. That's not even on the same level of what we are talking about. I could easily say that Lena Dunham is a proof that fathsaming doesn't exist because she is an ugly fat lady with a lot of money and fame.","1535435922"
