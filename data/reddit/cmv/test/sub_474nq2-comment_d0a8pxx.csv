Several of those articles have very low-quality information vibes to be as well (i.e., there will be a claim about something, then a link to a long article source that doesn't appear to overtly support or refute the claim).

Are you sure you're not dealing with a series of prima facie plausible-sounding-but-ultimately-unfounded *allegations*?","1456202102"

"JCAPS766","JCAPS766","If you ask Russians, the raison d'Ãªtre of the Western media is to slander and demonize Russia.  This is delusional, sometimes hilariously so.

In reality, most US media outside of professional foreign affairs media is just kinda ignorant about Russia, and views it as more of a movie character than a country.  This is generally out of ignorance. Russia has not been a prime foreign policy concern of the US from about 1994 until 2 years ago tomorrow, when the invasion of Crimea began.  ","1456235966"
