"botchedrobbery","botchedrobbery","This is completely illogical. He has caucused with the democrats since he got to congress. He supports their leadership regime and is even a part of it (he is the ranking democratic member on the banking committee). He has fund raised for the dems, campaigned for them, endorsed them, etc. To say Sanders is not a democrat is bizarre and simply factually incorrect. 

Hillary is not a life long democrat. She started out a ""Goldwater Girl"" and was a Republican in her early life. You can google that.","1469376952"

How are her opinions where as a college freshman relevant?

I always think it is bizarre when this is trotted out and suggested to be anything more than any mildly interesting tidbit about her life story. ","1469378553"

"aguafiestas","aguafiestas","I read the OP, why would I be commenting if I had not?

You can debate about how much Sanders was a democrat vs. a true independent in his political career, fine. It's a mixed picture and it's fair to disagree about which aspects of it are most important. 

But Hillary being a Republican as a college freshman is entirely irrelevant to that. There is no utility in comparing a 74 year old man's entire political career with someone's political views as a kid 50 years ago. ","1469379004"

"aguafiestas","aguafiestas","Nitpicking the exact details of the wording by treating an obvious figure of speech as being a strictly literal statement is a useless argument as well.

No one is a true ""lifelong"" Democrat since you can't join a political party until you turn 18. It's a figure of speech not meant to be taken literally. She has been a Democrat her entire political career and has been active in the Democratic party since college. 

Pointless nitpicking is not a good argument.","1469379313"
