"darwin2500","darwin2500","Then if two people are doing equal work, the better negotiator will be paid more.  Correct?

If so, that's an obvious example where two people do the same work for different pay.

This would disprove your claim 'There are literally zero jobs where people performing equal work do not have equal pay.'","1517857374"
"ZeusThunder369","ZeusThunder369","I'm not aware of any job where a person can negotiate salaries, but then do work that can be objectively measured to be equal. That'd be like negotiating your pay to start a factory job; That just doesn't happen.","1517858950"
