What is ambiguous about that?","1466468348"
"Chronic_Apathy1","Chronic_Apathy1","You're only quoting half of the amendment. That statement, taken on its own, is not ambiguous. That statement, in conjunction with the rest of the amendment, could be.","1466468954"
"We_Are_Not_Equal","We_Are_Not_Equal","But it says ""the right of **the people**."" I'm pretty sure ""the people"" refers to all US citizens. It doesn't say ""the right of the militia to keep and bear arms,"" or ""the right of state police to keep and bear arms.""

It very specifically says ""the people."" To me, that means all US citizens. Do you have any rationale for why it wouldn't mean ""all US citizens?""","1466470482"
"Chronic_Apathy1","Chronic_Apathy1","Because the militia clause could be interpreted to mean it only applies to U.S. citizens who are in a militia. I understand and respect the argument that says citizens can bear arms regardless of their inclusion in a militia, however, I believe that the argument that says citizens can only bear arms if they're involved in a militia is also valid.","1466471285"
"We_Are_Not_Equal","We_Are_Not_Equal","How is it a valid interpretation? We all speak the same language, right? The text very straightforwardly says ""the **right** of **THE PEOPLE** to keep and bear arms **shall not be infringed**."" There is absolutely nothing ambiguous about that. There is nothing to be interpreted. You are falling victim to a narrative that is trying to have you ignore your education in the English language so that gun-grabbers don't have to do the awfully hard work of getting an amendment ratified. ","1466471684"
"Chronic_Apathy1","Chronic_Apathy1","You're literally just quoting half of the amendment and then insisting the language isn't ambigious. Implying I don't understand the English language isn't a winning argument.","1466471786"
