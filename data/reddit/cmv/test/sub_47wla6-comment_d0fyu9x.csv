"blackwindfunny","blackwindfunny","Come on man, just because there are not polls about it doesn't mean it does not exist (remember what I said about hopping off of the PC train?). Your not going to change my view with a technicality. The burden of proof is on not on me in this sub, if you want to use that to try to change my view, then you provide a poll that says a majority of women want these things to equalize. ","1456596181"
"Birdy1072","Birdy1072","It's not a technicality.  You're making statements which means the burden of proof is on you.  

Edit: in addition to your edit, this has nothing to do with the *PC train*.  This is common debate etiquette.  You make a stand and then back it up with legitimate proof.  So yes, the burden of proof *is* on you.

Futhermore, you said yourself that ""there are not polls about it"".  Why would you expect me to find a poll that doesn't exist?","1456596277"

Boooooo...

This is intellectual cowardice. You have made a claim, if you want it to be taken seriously the onus is on you to back it up. Argumentation 101 man.","1456597485"

"franklymydeer","franklymydeer","If it's that clear that his assertion is true, he should be able to easily provide supporting evidence. 

I mean, that this group of people exists is the fundamental basis of his argument. His CMV literally begins with the words ""there exists"". Asked to provide some evidence that this group exists, his reply is ""I'm not going to engage with you any more. Good day.""

No matter whether you agree or not, this is really poor and it's right that he's being called out on it. ","1456598572"
