The problem is that completely benign things are considered bad at current rate of PC culture.

Are those insults?

Steve's comment that Carrie was a beautiful girl who turned to also be bright appeared insulting.
 
Chris Hemsworth dressing as an indian in a lone ranger themed party is considered an insult?

JT apologizing for giving a black guy a compliment that he inspired him?

Are all of those insults?","1530969847"
"CHOLO_ORACLE","CHOLO_ORACLE","They're definitely clumsy. Maybe they're not insults, but trying to deny that they were clumsy seems more of an insult to the people they were talking to than their clumsiness.","1530970912"
"nowthatsucks","nowthatsucks","No they weren't. They're completely benign.","1530971079"

You make it sound like their only two options are becoming hermits or continuously putting their foot in their mouths.","1530971615"

clumsy in what way?","1530972256"
"Madplato","Madplato","People sometimes do inappropriate things by accident - for instance dressing up as a caricature of X or Y groups - and they should be able to learn from these situations over time.","1530973622"
"nowthatsucks","nowthatsucks","How is dressing as an Indian a caricature? Is dressing as a cowboy a caricature as well?","1530973908"
"Madplato","Madplato","No, it's dressing *as* a caricature of Indians. And yes, most cowboy costumes will be caricatures,  that's the nature of a costume, but cowboys aren't a people.","1530975023"
"nowthatsucks","nowthatsucks","I mean this is going into semantics, you're not dressing as an Indian technically, you're dressing as they were dressing at the time, the same way you're dressing as white people were dressing at the time as well.

What's the difference between wearing a war bonnet or a cowboy hat?

Why is the one insulting the other is not? It's literally the same benign thing.","1530975363"

> What's the difference between wearing a war bonnet or a cowboy hat?

You don't earn a cowboy hat one fiber at a time through continual effort to contribute to the tribe. War bonnets aren't just something to wear, they're a collection of recognition of accomplishment.

> Why is the one insulting the other is not? It's literally the same benign thing.

Because one is taking something of reverence and respect and treating it like a costume, the other is a hat.","1530978167"
"nowthatsucks","nowthatsucks","So it's not okay to wear priest robes that symbolize a religion of some group, can I dress up as the pope? How about a veteran army clothes with many medals, can I dress as football player who won many stars competing in the champions league, how about a captain? How about a surgeon? How about a magistrate?

Are all of those offensive?

It's a dress up party, it's benign. ","1530978689"
