Sure we might have a controversial president but he was elected for a reason and universal healthcare wouldnt provide the same benefits as private healthcare and if it was me Id put more money in the military and VA fund to ensure that America is the greatest as well as the strongest country on Earth","1538845433"
"KingOfTheMexica","KingOfTheMexica","Universal healthcare has shown to be far superior than private. If it wasn’t for the private healthcare system, medical debt wouldn’t be the number one reason people go bankrupt in America 

The military serves no purpose being in any of the countries they are in, and have been in, since the Vietnam War. There is a reason the numbers show people enlisting down, bc it’s an unnecessary budget problem now that does no good ","1538845716"

Booming economy is the reason why people are not signing in","1538846808"
"KingOfTheMexica","KingOfTheMexica","Yeah no. The reason enlistment is down is because most people who are going to be enlisting now can see how evil and corrupt it is from watching the highlights of US military complex in the Iraq War and the farce it is ","1538846944"

"KingOfTheMexica","KingOfTheMexica","It is slavery tho bc none of those things exist and you only get them after working 80 hours a week in conditions that are in humane tho. And if you want change, your fired ","1538848879"
"vettewiz","vettewiz","...All of those things exist at Amazon. ","1538848957"
"KingOfTheMexica","KingOfTheMexica","Ignoring the part where I point out how bad Amazon is I see unless you are fellating the corporate sector ","1538849047"
"vettewiz","vettewiz","A job paying double minimum wage, with benefits, and bonuses, and overtime, with virtually no skills needed is hardly terrible. What world do you live in?","1538849122"
