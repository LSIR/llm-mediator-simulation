"ElysiX","ElysiX","Can you give an example of something you think is objectively immoral? ","1448382035"
"save_the_pigs","save_the_pigs","pirating a movie, because you are taking something away from the artist you are pirating it from. There is a victim and a Culprit. There is no victim to pirating a show I mentioned.","1448382388"
"ElysiX","ElysiX","Well then you are assuming taking something away from someone is objectively immoral. Taxes, fines, paid damages are all these immoral too?

And what if you do not care about the ""victim""? How is it immoral then?

More generally, for something to be objectively immoral there must not be any scenario where it would be the right choice to do. Lets say someone shoves a gun in your face and tells you to pirate a movie. Are you saying complying is the wrong thing to do?","1448383877"
"save_the_pigs","save_the_pigs","I was speaking in simplified terms. I don't want to go through every single situation where pirating a movie is moral and immoral. I was just trying to give an analogy.","1448384619"
"ElysiX","ElysiX","If it hasnt come across yet, my point is that there is no such thing as an objectively immoral action.","1448384688"
"save_the_pigs","save_the_pigs","Seriously? I mean we all know what morality is, you don't need to make this all 12th grade philosophy class. You can figure out what I meant in my post.","1448384925"
"ElysiX","ElysiX","> we all know what morality is [...] You can figure out what I meant

Yes and i figure you mean you (or your peers) have supreme authority over morals and that there is one moral system that is the right one, being your one, and all others are wrong.","1448385108"
