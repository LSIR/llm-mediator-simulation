"BadWookieInc","BadWookieInc","It's used as a race... Most black people call themselves African American and I can almost guarantee they have no idea what ethnicities they truly are. Most people have no idea, I didn't know I was mostly Norse until just recently and I'm 34. ","1517154335"

[This poll of black Americans](http://news.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx) shows that more people prefer the term ""African American"" than prefer the term ""black"".  However, more importantly, in my opinion, it shows that a majority don't care. Unfortunately, I can't find a poll showing how black Americans refer to themselves.","1517158899"
"forwardflips","forwardflips","Honestly think having the “doesn’t matter” option on this poll didn’t really help with getting which one is preferred . I would also choose doesn’t matter cause it’s saying the same thing. But if had to choose between the two, I would say black. Also the poll is 10 years old. Views have changed. ","1517176637"
"wfaulk","wfaulk","Yeah, it would have been nice if there was a poll that was ""how do you refer to your own 'race'"". But I think that OP was saying ""Most black people call themselves African American"" in a way of continuing his notion that the term ""African American"" is used in a separatist way. But I think it's reasonable to infer from that the fact that most black people don't care which term is used that there's not really any separatist intent, at least for those that don't care.","1517179874"
"BadWookieInc","BadWookieInc","My biggest peeve with the whole thing is why do people always look for ways to divide? I could easily start pushing the whole Norse American thing and probably have another option added to govt documents if I want... But that's stupid. I align myself with my country because it's given me more opportunity than anywhere else could have. It serves me as I serve it. ","1517194004"
"BeardedForHerPleasur","BeardedForHerPleasur","Okay, we've established that you want to take the term ""African-American"" away from black people who wish to use it. What do you want to replace it with?","1517202745"
