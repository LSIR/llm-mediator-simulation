Call this person a male and you would be confusing anyone who might have a sexual interest in this person.

Call this person a female and you would be confusing anyone who is looking for a 'her'.

Call this person transgender identifying as male and all is clear.","1516134935"

I remember a time when someone who acted differently was still called what they Are, now someone had a different sense of fashion and everyone thinks they're a different gender.","1516141580"

Go to Thailand someday.  I bet most straight men would appreciate it if that beautiful women over there identified herself as trans-gender.

> now someone had a different sense of fashion and everyone thinks they're a different gender.

""Everyone"" is horribly overstating it.  The vast majority of people self-identify as male when they have a penis and female when they have a vagina.","1516142007"

"peyj_","peyj_","Except you are blowing this problem way out of proportion, dude. 

Sure there are some hipsters who call themselves non-binary just because they want to be cool and different. 

But that's just not the reason people are pushing for these rights. This is for people who actually care about their gender being reflected. ","1516145545"
