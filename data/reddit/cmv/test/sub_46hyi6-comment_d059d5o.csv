"SilhouetteMan","SilhouetteMan","I'm actually against social programs. The welfare and social security systems are highly flawed for instance. However a universal basic income would allow people to do whatever they want with the money instead of what the government thinks what's best for you. ","1455843704"
"AlwaysABride","AlwaysABride","So which of the following statements is true:

1. You believe that a universal basic income is a Libertarian policy, or

2. You no longer think that Libertarianism is the best policy.","1455846482"
"SilhouetteMan","SilhouetteMan","UBI isn't a libertarian idea and I never said that I am 100% libertarian. All I said was that I side with libertarianism most because I feel like its the best we've got. UBI I feel is necessary to ensure a minimum standard of living.","1455847175"

Your CMV **LITERALLY SAYS** that libertarianism is the **ONE TRUE** political philosophy. It literally says that anyone who does not believe in libertarian ideas should reevaluate their political beliefs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Your embracing of UBI is an obvious, and absolutely incontrovertible **rejection** of libertarian thought. 

What is this CMV actually about? ","1455849973"

Do you see the inherent contradiction between your OP, and the Following statement?

"SilhouetteMan","SilhouetteMan","So the fact that I support basic income means I can no longer be a libertarian?","1455857614"
