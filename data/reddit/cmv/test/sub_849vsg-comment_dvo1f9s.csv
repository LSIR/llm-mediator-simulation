"kublahkoala","kublahkoala","Hate speech laws had an essential role in the denazification of Germany. I don’t think hate speech laws are helpful everywhere, but they are effective in certain historical situations, such as when you are trying to counteract the brainwashing of entire populations. I don’t see how Germany’s transition to democracy would have been possible if after WW-II we allowed the Nazis to run for office, to teach at school, to pump money into the media, to organize marches and protests, etcetera.

"ticklesandprickles","ticklesandprickles","Δ I agree with this, everything in context.  If there were an especially violent city in America that promoted a lot of hate speech, then some temporary regulations could be beneficial until the violence (or whatever else) calms down. I still don't think the 1st amendment should be violated by the federal government though. ","1520998832"
"Silent_Samp","Silent_Samp","Are you serious? The point of the right to free speech is that it is a right that cannot be infringed. The right is supposed to be a right regardless of a particular Rocky or violent time, that is exactly when that right needs protecting. You'd give up on that so easily? ","1521025664"

Explain why those limits are okay, or explain why those limits should be abolished.","1521038551"
"Silent_Samp","Silent_Samp","No. The comment I replied to was talking about restricting free speech on the basis of things unrelated to slander/threats, you're asking me to argue a point I didn't make and don't hold ","1521040044"
"ghaziaway","ghaziaway",">  The point of the right to free speech is that it is a right that cannot be infringed. 

It's already been infringed.

You are not free to say literally anything you want to because if you want to threaten someone with speech, you will be arrested.

Argue why that's an okay restriction, but restricting calls for genocide isn't.","1521040530"
