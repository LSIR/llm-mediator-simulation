"DaraelDraconis","DaraelDraconis","If I get a tattoo, am I the same person *in a more meaningful sense than the old philosophical ""can't cross the same river twice"" one*?

If not, *why not*?

If the sense I tried to exclude is the sense you meant, how is it relevant to the conversation at hand, given that in the same sense the employee who turns up for work is not the one who was hired?","1534708063"

This sense is irrelevant to judging whether you should keep the job or not.","1534708098"
"DaraelDraconis","DaraelDraconis","Indeed it is, which is why I tried to explicitly exclude it from consideration. So, given that minor changes in someone's physical composition *don't* change who they are, do you have a basis for your claim that someone who gets a tattoo is not the same person?  If so, *what is it*?","1534708323"

"DaraelDraconis","DaraelDraconis","Not given the already-established exclusion of the ""can't cross the same river twice"" sense, it doesn't - not unless those changes actually alter someone's behaviour or physical capabilities.  Again: in what way *relevant to the discussion at hand* does getting a tattoo change who a person is?","1534708502"
"hammerhaunts","hammerhaunts","Because the philosophical sense is irrelevant to the person keeping the job, which is why I have dismissed it, which is why your badgering about it is entirely irrelevant to this conversation.","1534708569"
"DaraelDraconis","DaraelDraconis","I think you need to reread what I wrote.  I'm not badgering you for an answer in the philosophical sense; I'm saying that changes in physical composition that do not change a person's personality, skills, or physical capabilities are *equivalent* to the philosophical sense, and thus irrelevant, and asking for an explanation of why you say a tattoo changes who someone is that *is* relevant to this conversation.","1534708664"

But they are relevant to whether the person should be fired or not.","1534708732"
"DaraelDraconis","DaraelDraconis","You keep asserting this, but you haven't provided *any* support for it, and you're simultaneously claiming that something equivalent is *not* relevant.  Please either - or preferably *both* - lay out what you consider the difference to be, or explain how changes in composition that don't affect someone's ability to do their job are relevant to whether or not they should be fired.","1534708924"
