"AnythingApplied","AnythingApplied","Singing songs around the campfire while someone plays on their guitar is a camping pastime that was very special to me and I really can't imagine trying to prevent people from the tradition of singing campfire songs.

I understand that ""playing music"" on a bluetooth device might be a bit different to you than ""playing music"" on a guitar, but I wanted to make sure that that differentiation is there as I see no issues with people playing music on instruments.","1535932455"
"estheredna","estheredna","Yes I agree.  I’m talking about ‘music as background noise’ not actively making music with friends.","1535932874"

"choke_on_my_downvote","choke_on_my_downvote","not the person you asked but I came here to say the same sk I'll answer. Music traveling from a speaker while camping has a harsh, grating sound because it's a shitty 3"" speaker. The sound that travels from human voices and an acoustic guitar (for example) is actually very pleasant to the ears. I realize that's an opinion but it's true just the same. There is nothing more aggravating to hear carrying from another camp than the high range only noise of a small speaker. ","1535956134"
"thief90k","thief90k","So by that logic it's fine if the speaker is better and makes good quality sound?","1535957165"
"choke_on_my_downvote","choke_on_my_downvote","Well it's way beyond that but for the sake of argument if you recorded people singing and playing guitar using really nice gear and then had some audiophile set up a speaker system that would emulate the exact output as real people than yes I suppose a bigger speaker would change my opinion? Good grief ","1535959407"
"thief90k","thief90k","Why good grief?

You just admitted that your view is not based on the music itself.  You're upset because your view was changed on CMV?","1535960305"
"choke_on_my_downvote","choke_on_my_downvote","You're being obstinate by suggesting that. The initial discussion was why it's acceptable to play a guitar and sing while camping as opposed to playing music through the sound systems that everyone brings camping. ","1535960780"
