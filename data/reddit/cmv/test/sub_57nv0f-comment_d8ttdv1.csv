California: Please sell the drugs at the prices offered to VA.

Drug Companies: No.

California: Okay, you can't sell any drugs of any type in California.","1476583029"

Others have mentioned the state can try to get the drugs from other sources, but if that's the case, why aren't they doing it already?

Common things like Epipens have increased in price dramatically and there's no indication people have alternarives.

There are other drugs like certain Cancer drugs and infection drugs that are lifesaving and no other sources exist according to the voter information guide.

Pharma needs (wants) the money more. Beside that, there are other pharmaeceutical companies who would be glad to sell there. Then there's cuba that was under an international boycot for many decates, and see, they made their own medicines.","1476620427"

This sentence doesn't really make sense, but I'm going to guess no? Not sure what point you're trying to make.

ELI5: do you think multinationals can suffer from greed or are they exempt?

Are you claiming a human being that has no money has no right to water? You *do* realise a person needs water to survive, do you?","1477097396"
