You offer no reasons as to why a solution that is difficult to dismantle is better. Actually, you just copy paste your first paragraph. Can you help me understand your reasoning?","1529669585"
"days_of_being_mild","days_of_being_mild","I'm operating under the assumption that we should have a border.  This shouldn't be a matter of debate.  Have a debate about how many legal asylum seekers we should allow in, sure.  Have a debate about issuing merit-based vs non-discriminatory visas.  These are good debates.  Undermining the existence of a border (as has been Democratic policy and passive establishment Republican policy for decades) shouldn't be debatable.","1529670292"
