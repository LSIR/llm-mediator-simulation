No offense intended here but if you're still virgin at 26 you're not an ""average guy"".","1483198321"

"YoSoyUnPayaso","YoSoyUnPayaso","I don't know what you look like so I can't comment on looks alone but the average age of losing your virginity is far under 26 so if you're still a virgin at 26 you're not average.","1483198533"
"Nh10188","Nh10188","Well I meant average in terms of looks ","1483198609"
"PM_ME_YOUR_LURCH","PM_ME_YOUR_LURCH","Yeah, being a virgin at 26 is not a good indicator of looks. ","1483205694"

"FuzzerPupper","FuzzerPupper","Wow! That is truly proof of what a ""relationship"" means today. As well as a great indication of why the divorce rate is so high. Romance is dead (for the most part). The important factors are looks for the young and financial security for the old, the only personality trait of interest is tolerability. 


That is really depressing. When did actual liking of a *person* (friendship) become a totally unnecessary part of the equation?
