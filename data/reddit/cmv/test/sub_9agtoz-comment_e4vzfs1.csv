"Dammit_Banned_Again","Dammit_Banned_Again","Much the same as ANTIFA doesn’t represent the thinking of the liberal left, these über-right Christian ‘conservatives’ don’t represent the majority of modern conservatives. They’re simply louder &amp; whinier. They get ratings. ","1535326041"
"Plain_Bread","Plain_Bread","That doesn't seems like a fair comparison. About 60% of republicans think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Last I looked less than 60% of dems identified as antifa ""member"". ","1539766366"
