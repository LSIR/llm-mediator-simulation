"Diesel_Serengeti","Diesel_Serengeti","While I agree that the occupation will continue, actually annexing all of Palestine would make Jewish Israelis the minority allowing Palestinians to outvote them. Israel would never allow this situation as it would put them at an enormous disadvantage in policy.","1510585718"
"theessentialnexus","theessentialnexus","Are annexed Palestinians getting the right to vote as of now?  Are the Palestinians displaced living in Israel, emigrating to somewhere like Jordan, or are they just living in a relatively smaller area?  I would think they must be emigrating otherwise the population density would get ridiculous, or they would be committing all kinds of crime in Israel.","1510585913"
"MrGraeme","MrGraeme","> Are annexed Palestinians getting the right to vote as of now?

Yes. Palestinians living in annexed territories are given the option of receiving Israeli citizenship(such as those in Jerusalem), which gives them the right to vote. ","1510586470"
"Trump_is_Christ","Trump_is_Christ","Israel will no longer exist in 50 years as the United States will have de facto (and possibly de jure)collapsed by then, and the US is the only thing that keeps Israel afloat.","1510673300"
"MrGraeme","MrGraeme","Good luck with that. I'm fairly confident Israel is the only nuclear-capable state in the middle east, and so long as that stands chances are good it's not going down any time soon. ","1510673782"
"Trump_is_Christ","Trump_is_Christ","The argument is within 50 years, do you think Iran won’t have nukes by then?  Will there be any countries without nukes by then?","1510676455"
"MrGraeme","MrGraeme","The ""argument"" is a baseless and misinformed claim. What do you think would cause this collapse of the Israeli state?","1510679311"
"Trump_is_Christ","Trump_is_Christ","Idk, probably the loss of billions in Aid and hundreds of billions in military support from the US?","1510679681"
"MrGraeme","MrGraeme","Do you even understand what you're talking about? Israel gets [$3B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid) in *total* aid from the United States every year. This represents around [1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Israel) of Israel's GDP.

Please explain to me how a 1% reduction in GDP leads to the collapse of a modern, highly developed, nuclear power.","1510680425"
"Trump_is_Christ","Trump_is_Christ","Its more to do with the US military being almost 600B a year and being completely subservient to Israel.  That is what keeps some of the actual Islamic countries away.  As soon as the US and that protection goes away, Israel loses its shield.","1510680642"
"MrGraeme","MrGraeme","Yep, that's exactly what happened during the [Six Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War), where the Israeli military absolutely crushed Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon in less than a week. Oh wait, Israel did that on its own.

Care to point to a single example of the United States directly helping Israel in a war? Oh wait, there [aren't any](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Israel).

"Trump_is_Christ","Trump_is_Christ","You seem to be forgetting that we are talking about the future here.  Your argument is essentially “look at how this first world nation is stomping on all these dirt poor countries that didnt even exist a few years ago because they were under colonial occupation, we can assume this situation won’t change in the next 100 years!”","1510682686"
"MrGraeme","MrGraeme","Ah yes, I was forgetting about this imaginary future where these countries somehow become successful and powerful in spite of the significant challenges they're being plagued by, all while the economically successful and militaristicly powerful Israel mysteriously stagnates to the point where these nations are able to eclipse it! How could I forget!
