If you ever pull up a list, teachers' top complaint is conditions. ","1506565176"
"jomac84","jomac84","That is actually another issue I wanted to discuss in another post at a later date. I certainly got that sentiment as well from the teachers whoâ€™ve had these discussions with me. Thank you for the link!","1506565918"
"anonoman925","anonoman925","So more pay is moot if conditions don't improve, therefore your OP is null. ","1506566468"
"Salanmander","Salanmander","I don't think that's actually reasonable. One problem being more dire doesn't make another problem unimportant. For a much more drastic example, consider hurricane relief. If people have no electricity and no clean water, they're going to list no clean water as a much bigger problem. But that doesn't mean that the statement ""we should work to restore power"" is false.","1506567783"

We're bleeding teachers. 50% over 5 yrs. ","1506568618"
"Salanmander","Salanmander",">  If you're bleeding, cancer treatment comes 2nd.

True, but again, ""it would be better for this person not to have cancer"" is also true.","1506594957"
"anonoman925","anonoman925","Teachers are leaving in droves. My district just gave raises. Turnover is still just as high. 

Now what? ","1506603991"
"Salanmander","Salanmander","I doubt your district has enough teachers in it to be able to reliably notice within one year if there is a 5% change in teacher turnover, and yet a 5% change is relevant.","1506609067"
"anonoman925","anonoman925","It's over a few years. 

We swap out all of site admin every 5 yrs on avg, so every 5 we get new marching orders, have to deal with new bullshit slung at us, will I be called racist for writing referrals (this happened to me), will the Principal torpedo an interview of mine or let a suspected pedophile go without telling leadership (happened), will an admin assault and batter me at a party and be in charge of evaluating me (happened).","1506614721"
"Salanmander","Salanmander","I get that conditions suck. I just think that conditions sucking is not a reason to *avoid raising pay*.","1506614854"
"anonoman925","anonoman925","But the argument of 'just raise pay' is dumb. 

If you say teachers shouldn't get paid more, I ask would you like an extra $500 a month. 

You're dumb if you say no. 

So you want more pay. Everyone would like more pay, therefore it's inconsistent to say that others shouldn't get more pay. People will always overvalue themselves and undervalue others. ","1506615234"
"Salanmander","Salanmander","The statement wasn't ""raising pay is the only way we should improve the situation of teachers"". It also wasn't ""teachers would like to be paid more"" (which is true but meaningless, as you point out). It was ""teachers should be paid more"". If you want to talk about it in terms of valuation, it would be ""the true value of teachers is higher than what they are currently being paid"".","1506615414"
"anonoman925","anonoman925","> ""teachers should be paid more

Is the OP. There was nothing else mentioned or mention of prioritization. ","1506616248"
"Salanmander","Salanmander","I know. You don't have to mention ""teachers should be paid more but it's more important for working conditions to be improved"" in order for the statement ""teachers should be paid more"" to be true.","1506617163"
