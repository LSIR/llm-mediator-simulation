"-Randy-Marsh-","-Randy-Marsh-","I'm so proud of you. So you have one flag that fought to abolish slavery and another one that fought to uphold it. 

Can you explain to me how those are the same?","1531335703"

"-Randy-Marsh-","-Randy-Marsh-","Is it really so complicated that you need to broken down even more for you?","1531343987"
