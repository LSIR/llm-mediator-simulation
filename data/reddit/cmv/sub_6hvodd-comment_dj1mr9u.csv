"moonflower","moonflower","There is no discrimination against non-sexual people and they do not have to fight for any legal rights ... you can't include the ''discrimination'' they would get from being rejected from the LGBT community, because heterosexuals are also rejected, on the same grounds, that they are not LG or B.","1497740494"
"iProbablyLikeYoux","iProbablyLikeYoux","The legal rights part is interesting, but LGBTQAI+ etc... Is a place for sexual minorities to feel proud and united. Surely asexuality is a part of this, even if they don't face legal prejudices?","1497769727"
"moonflower","moonflower","No, it's nothing to be proud of if you don't face discrimination.","1497777662"
"iProbablyLikeYoux","iProbablyLikeYoux","Asexuals do face discrimination.","1497778378"
"moonflower","moonflower","We have already established that we don't agree on this, so unless you can show how they face discrimination, we are just going round in circles now.","1497780835"
"ShreddingRoses","ShreddingRoses","One of the single most common threads in the asexual experience is corrective rapes. Ace people have also occasionally been subjected to conversion therapy. Ace people are discriminated against.","1497789528"
"moonflower","moonflower","Heterosexual women are raped by rapists who do not accept that the woman does not desire to have sex with them - it's nothing to do with sexual orientation, it's based on rejecting the rapist - the rapist will ''correct'' any woman who rejects him.","1497791831"
"ShreddingRoses","ShreddingRoses","I guess lesbians aren't correctively raped either. It's not an attempt to change them through aggressive and violent male patriarchy. Nope. Couldn't possibly be that.","1497792042"
"moonflower","moonflower","Could you make your point clearly and without the use of sarcasm? It is not appropriate for this discussion subreddit.","1497792195"
"ShreddingRoses","ShreddingRoses","My point is very clear. You know full and well you are wrong about this.","1497792629"
"moonflower","moonflower","OK, you can get back to me if you decide to have a civil discussion about it.","1497795980"
