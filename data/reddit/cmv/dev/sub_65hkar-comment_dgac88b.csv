That's an authoritarian view. Your position is a contradiction.","1492234351"
"30blues","30blues","I never claimed that my view isn't authoritarian. Here, I'll be more specific:

People should not be allowed to spread authoritarian views **besides mine**.

"30blues","30blues","I don't get a special privilege. My view does. Because it's right.","1492236084"
"-AragornElessar-","-AragornElessar-","Who says it is right? You do.  Why should the rest of us acknowledge that? ","1492236143"
"30blues","30blues","You shouldn't if you don't agree with me. I'm just expressing *my* view of how the world should work, and I'm trying to change it because it's inconsistent with my other beliefs.","1492236294"
"-AragornElessar-","-AragornElessar-","Your view is self-contradictory. You say that your view is the only correct view and that every one else should bend to that because all others are wrong.  That is what an authoritarian says.  How can you be anti-authoritarianism when you have a view that is authoritarian in nature.  It's paradoxical.  

It's like when Obi-Wan Kenobi says to Anakin Skywalker that ""Only a Sith deals in abosulutes.""  That in itself is an an absolute statement, making it a paradox. Your view is just like that. ","1492236446"

that's my issue. I've always believed that I wasn't an authoritarian but if I believe this then maybe that's not the case.","1492237044"
"-AragornElessar-","-AragornElessar-","It's quite simple. 

1) Your view is authoritatian. 
2) You believe authoritarian views should be stamped out. 

Now, a question. Do you believe your view should be stamped out?   

If yes, then your view is logically consistent. 

If no, then your view is logically inconsistent and meaningless, so you shouldn't hold it. ","1492237166"
"30blues","30blues","Here's an adjustment that makes my view more logically consistent: Authoritarian views **besides my own** should be stamped out.","1492237971"
