"Sundsin","Sundsin","i'm saying pedophile can fantasize about sex with a consensual child

and that furries don't exist in the real world","1484751993"
"Nepene","Nepene","Legally, and morally, children can't consent to sex. So, there are no consensual child sex fantasies.

They clearly do, there are picturies of furries and many stories online.","1484754180"

"Nepene","Nepene","Yeah, but that doesn't mean we have to accept other's definitions of their acts.

Sex with children is nonconsensual. If you fantasize about children saying yes to sex that doesn't make your fantasies consensual, any more than fantasizing about raping someone drunk and unconscious is consensual if they have a short skirt and you believe short skirts make it consensual. 

Non consensual is non consensual.","1484755119"

"Nepene","Nepene","I'd view that view as toxic to victims of sexual assault, as redefining  non consensual acts as consensual in your mind means that if you share your views on Reddit or Irc or whatever sexual predators may see it as social approval for sexual abuse of real children.","1484762312"
