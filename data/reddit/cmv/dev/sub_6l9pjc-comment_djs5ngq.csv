You might not think much of the symbolic aspect of getting married, but that doesn't mean that the practical and legal institution is outdated or useless.","1499203239"

I'd prefer you take the time to inform yourself on a subject before presuming to speak on it.

This is ""Change My View"", not ""Do My Research For Me"" or ""Dispell My Ignorance"". If you don't have enough knowledge of a subject, its an excellent reason to refrain from having a view on it.","1499203951"
"conradwinkles","conradwinkles","The only legal recourses I've ever heard of involve joint custody of children, property, and accounts. That would not total to over 1500+ laws. And in many cases, a douchebag judge might not look upon a specific individual favorably, so what laws benefit a married couple? ","1499204899"

"[deleted]","[deleted]","Not a joke.

What is it about informing yourself before you chose to speak on a subject that you find so distasteful?

Why should the people in this forum spend their time and energy debating  with your willfully ignorance?","1499208654"
"conradwinkles","conradwinkles","You haven't provided me with anything different. Every ""benefit"" that has been thrown at me I have acknowledged and explained how to get around that circumstance. You aren't providing anything useful with your comment aside from putting yourself on a pedestal. ","1499208759"
"[deleted]","[deleted]","That doesn't answer the questions I asked.

**You** haven't bothered to provide **yourself** with anything to begin with. Why should anyone engage with you if that's the case?

And how am I putting myself on a pedestal? By suggesting you learn about things before you talk about them?","1499210106"
