"KevinWester","KevinWester","Speaking as an American and regarding wars like WWII where America can actually be threatened by the results (not Vietnam)....

I benefit from and enjoy all of the rights and social services we have here. In fact, America and the opportunities we have here are the reason I have money in the bank, an education, etc. So if I want to continue to enjoy these rights, don't you think I owe it to fight when called upon in a critical situation to defend the country?

"_Atlamillia_","_Atlamillia_","I clearly don't, and clearly neither does society, as the draft has been abolished.

Obviously were I someone born before WW2 with those sensibilities I might say otherwise, but I was not, and I do not. I do not blame anyone who saw war going on, and said ""yeah no I'd rather not participate in that"". ","1519680696"
"KevinWester","KevinWester","So from a moral or ethical standpoint, why would you be entitled to everything good that America provides without having to give back in a critical situation such as (hypothetical of course), China invading our West Coast. Why are you leaving that up to others? Isn't that freeloading? 

Want to emphasize that I'm with you on drafts for wars that have no direct outcome that will affect our ongoing rights and freedoms.

"_Atlamillia_","_Atlamillia_","> why would you be entitled to everything good that America provides without having to give back

That's basically a right of citizenship.

> Why are you leaving that up to others? Isn't that freeloading?

Others have signed up. I have not. It's not my job. I have the right for it not to be my job. ","1519684171"
"KevinWester","KevinWester","But again, isn't it freeloading? Drafts occur when there aren't enough people signed up. At the time of a draft, they literally need more people to succeed, and aren't getting a big enough response to fulfill their needs. 

And with citizenship comes responsibility, like paying taxes, to keep the country alive and moving. Should I have the right to opt out of paying taxes yet still enjoy all the social benefits they fund like law enforcement and  firefighters and highways? ","1519684586"
"_Atlamillia_","_Atlamillia_","Is tax money equivalent to a human life? No, it's not. ","1519686250"
"KevinWester","KevinWester","It's just a general question. Why do I have to pay taxes for the police department that keeps me safe? Why can't I just opt out, assume others will pay, and continue to be entitled to the services anyways indefinitely? 

What's your opinion? You okay with this? ","1519686819"
"_Atlamillia_","_Atlamillia_","You are trying to draw parallels where they do not exist.

This is an unrelated, irrelevant topic, because *paying some of your earnings to support infrastructure that keeps the country running* is not the same thing as *paying your entire fucking life*. 

You cannot equate the two.","1519687757"
"KevinWester","KevinWester","Sure you can. If I don't pay taxes and you don't pay taxes, all this stuff goes away. 

If I don't fight and you don't fight, then (potentially) our country goes away. 

The message is if you want social services you should be on the hook to pay taxes. If you want your country to exist you should be on the hook to fight in absolute dire situations. 

You don't see the connection there? 
","1519688345"
"_Atlamillia_","_Atlamillia_","Nope.

You're forcing people to go die just because of where they were born. It's fucked up, and it's wrong.","1519688411"
"KevinWester","KevinWester","Why is that fucked up when the very existence of your home and your country is being threatened? Would you rather see your country taken over and all your rights and freedoms to go away? 

I don't get your angle! ","1519688618"
