"Weasel_Cannon","Weasel_Cannon","So, as a child I had an emergency circumcision. At 3 yrs old the tip of my foreskin got infected And swelled to the size of a golf ball, so I was whisked to the hospital and quickly had it removed. I'm not aware of the stats, but I've always been told that besides the physical look, the reason many ppl are circumcised is to remove the possibility for complications in the future.","1455745451"
"PwnkingAOD","PwnkingAOD","Some people get other body parts amputated at birth if they get infected. That doesn't really justify preemptive amputation. ","1455748985"
"Weasel_Cannon","Weasel_Cannon","Though I don't really care one way or the other, I would argue that the relative uselessness of the foreskin makes the decision to haphazardly remove it much easier than, say, elective removal of your big toe or left forearm.","1455766925"

"PwnkingAOD","PwnkingAOD","Not directly on something as important as a sex organ, in that case it most definitely has a purpose ","1456634365"
"Strbrst","Strbrst","I was just saying that your argument of ""we're born with it so it's important"" is not very good. ","1456671718"
"PwnkingAOD","PwnkingAOD","I never said it was important if you're born with it. learn to read.","1456677210"
"Strbrst","Strbrst","You argued, ""It's extremely practical that's why we are born with one..."". HOWEVER, arguing that a part of the human body - any part for that matter - is practical because we have it is an invalid argument. Which is what you did. Yes, I'm sure that particular body part is exceptionally important, but that doesn't change the fact that you're arguing it the wrong way.

Also, I can read plenty well, thank you. I'm sure you meant that I misinterpreted the meaning of what you so cleverly wrote.","1456679070"
