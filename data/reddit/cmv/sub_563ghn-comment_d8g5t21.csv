"icedpickles","icedpickles","Yes that's why I posted a CMV in the first place. A (reasonable) counter example to my assertion, that I can't explain, would change my view ","1475737226"
"Sheexthro","Sheexthro","> If you thought that you would feel bad for doing something, then you would not do it.

Well, how about a counterexample to this one. I just hit myself really hard in the thigh, knowing that it would hurt - *intending* that it would hurt, in fact. Now I feel bad, because I hit myself really hard in the thigh for no good reason. This really happened just now.","1475737489"
"icedpickles","icedpickles","Why did you hit yourself?","1475739267"
"Sheexthro","Sheexthro","To demonstrate that it's possible to do something you know will feel bad.","1475764847"
"icedpickles","icedpickles","So you did it an an attempt to gain some form of positive feeling from cmv ","1475802125"
"Sheexthro","Sheexthro","No, I did not. I did it for the reason I explained to you.","1475805229"
"icedpickles","icedpickles","Yeah, and that reason you decided to demonstrate was because of this cmv. Why are responding to my cmv in the first place?","1475809161"
"Sheexthro","Sheexthro","Because I want to.","1475809693"

"Sheexthro","Sheexthro","What do you mean, why? Aren't *you* the one who's supposed to tell *me* why I do every single thing? *You're* the one who has asserted - with no evidence - that every single deliberate act someone takes is done in order to *make them feel emotionally good*.","1475809935"
"icedpickles","icedpickles","I asked you a basic question that you supposedly know the answer to. How hard is it to answer?","1475811091"
"Sheexthro","Sheexthro","It's extremely easy to answer, but *you're* the one who asserts that he knows the motivations of every human in the world, so you need to use your theory to account for my motivations.","1475811252"
"icedpickles","icedpickles","Stoping making false accusations.

If you know the answer, then answer it.","1475812253"
"Sheexthro","Sheexthro","My accusation is in no way false. You are the one who asserts a total theory of human motivation. This should be an easy one to answer.","1475812339"
