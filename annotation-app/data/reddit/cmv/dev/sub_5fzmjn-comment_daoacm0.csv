"NESIRGNIK","NESIRGNIK","Because they didn't evolve in Europe. When I say Jews I'm not talking about the religion, but rather the distinct ethnic group. White is just a synonym for those that historically evolved in Europe. 

Also, why would this be a shit post? Because I have different views than you currently? ","1480632411"

"NESIRGNIK","NESIRGNIK","Most Russians aren't white (or not at least fully), so that makes sense. Lots of mongoloid blood mixed in, just like with Fins and Eastern Slavs (which are separate from Polish slavs).","1480632841"
"-AragornElessar-","-AragornElessar-","You say you are a white nationalist, but several of your comments including this one suggest that a more accurate label would be white supremacist. So, are you a white supremacist? ","1480634773"
"NESIRGNIK","NESIRGNIK","Supremacist implies that I wish for the white race to rule over others or I think there is some objective way to measure superiority. So no. '

What in this comment led you to believe that, anyways? ","1480635719"
"-AragornElessar-","-AragornElessar-","First, terms like Mongoloid are generally only still used by racists/white supremacists and found most often in their rhetoric. 

In your original post, you claim that ""white Europeans"" are superior. You claim that they have accomplished far more than any other race in the world. That is white supremacism. ","1480636117"
