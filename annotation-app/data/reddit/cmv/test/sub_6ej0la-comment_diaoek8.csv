"azur08","azur08","When people say they're afraid of death, they're not talking about instantaneous and unexpected lack of life.  The process of dying is scary to people.  Whether it's illness (old age counts as illness as it is heart failure),   a car accident, or being murdered, those concepts are scary to people... and they are to you too.   ","1496276574"

I agree that it is rational to fear the process of dying, but not death as I have defined it.  And my definition of death is what is relevant to this discussion.","1496276637"
"azur08","azur08","If you want to talk about your definition, you're looking at this a little too pragmatically.  Your point is that death is just an end.  However it's not necessarily irrational to fear the potential that death isn't just an end but rather a beginning to something worse.     ","1496277056"

I agree, but we are assuming here (per OP) that death is the end.","1496277327"
"azur08","azur08","But why?  I assumed that one was supposed to post here with a view that other people didn't have.  Going by your narrow post, and going by it so literally, doesn't have a point.  

You're asking as if you hold an opinion people would have reason to oppose you on yet I can't think of a person who would.  Again, meaningless exercise. ","1496278165"

Except that many people who do not believe in an afterlife still fear death by my definition.","1496278589"
"azur08","azur08","I didn't say you have to believe in the afterlife.  You just have to believe in the ""potential"" for something to come afterward.  Call it fear of the unknown of you want.  It's not irrational.    

Also that claim you just made... I'm not even sure I support that. ","1496280024"

I am assuming that there is no such ""potential"".","1496280100"
