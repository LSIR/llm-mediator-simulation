"mrbeck1","mrbeck1","So the big factor is luck? The crime is the crime. Whether or not multiple crimes are added to the spree is what determines how serious the charges are. I mean, so if someone crashes into me drunk and sticks around to take their punishment, you think the consequence should be LESS for them than the guy that gets pinched a block away from his house? That’s the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. What if he kills someone?","1533692541"
"fnybny","fnybny","If the result is that lives could be saved, then why does it matter why it happened?  I say this presupposing that achieving better outcomes is the primary concern of the judicial system.","1533692737"
"mrbeck1","mrbeck1","Because the way you save lives is by encouraging collisions? How is this even a conversation. ","1533692829"
"fnybny","fnybny","I  fail to see why increasing the punishment for intoxicated vehicular manslaughter would encourage drunk driving, and thus collisions.  Drunk drivers are not rational actors and the vast majority of them obviously don't believe that they will kill anyone, so they wouldn't care about the punishment.","1533693432"
"mrbeck1","mrbeck1","I feel like you aren’t even understanding your own argument. What do you think “more lenient” means?","1533693646"
"fnybny","fnybny",">  less severe","1533693725"
"mrbeck1","mrbeck1","So your argument is that if someone hits another car or person, their punishment should be less severe than someone just getting caught driving?","1533694326"
"fnybny","fnybny","Yes, so that they will be more likely to stop and aid the wounded by contacting the authorities and thus, the emergency services.","1533694403"
