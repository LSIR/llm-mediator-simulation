If there was real journalism involved, there would be police reports, witness statements, video footage, and actual evidence. ","1478809001"
"Kaepernick12","Kaepernick12","How convenient to deny that racism against people of color aren't happening.  Take the asian girl for instance, who the hell would waste 30-45 minutes of their time typing up fake story on facebook? For what reason? To get likes?

"bnicoletti82","bnicoletti82","Yes people do fake victimhood to push a narrative - just like the girl who claimed to be attacked by Obama supporters for being a republican.  

Why rant on facebook instead of calling the police and filing charges?

"Kaepernick12","Kaepernick12","Being told to ""go back to your country"" isn't a criminal offense worth filing charges or calling the police for.  

I despise Trump and his supporters, yet I wouldn't waste my time and day to make up a fake personal story about Trump supporters verbally or physically attacking me.

Speaking as an Asian-American, who HAS been on the receiving end of racial abuse in non-diverse parts of America, I believe her.  ","1478809525"

"Kaepernick12","Kaepernick12","More like speaking from personal experience from one Asian-American to another (the one in Shaun King's tweets) based on our shared experiences.  Is that not allowed?  ","1478813143"
"Danktron","Danktron","Of course it is, but an Asian can lie just like anyone else. ""Listen and believe"" is a pretty low standard of proof for evidence that ""Trump's victory has signaled that a large portion of White America has declared war on people of color.""

E: Oh wow, you're using Sean ""Fake Being Black For Cred"" King as a reference?","1478815562"
