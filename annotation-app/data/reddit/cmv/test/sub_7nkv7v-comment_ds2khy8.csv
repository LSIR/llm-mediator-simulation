"[deleted]","[deleted]","The chances of you getting free (and staying free) successfully are fairly low. Plus, the consequences can be extremely high when you don’t have much left to loose. For instance, taking away someone’s conjugal visits or putting them into solitary. ","1514884896"
"Scared_Moose","Scared_Moose","While I agree that most escape attempts are short lived if they even succeed, that small chance, in my mind is the only hope one could reasonably have. One can have all the privileges a prison could provide, but you will still be a prisoner.","1514885893"

"jm0112358","jm0112358","You could view the Earth as one really, really big cage that nature locks us into, and few people have briefly escaped. Yet, many are able to live fulfilling lives within this cage.","1514937807"
"TMac1128","TMac1128","Did human evolution acclimate us for 12x12 physical and mental prison environments? ","1514942652"
"jm0112358","jm0112358","Most prisons have open spaces and outdoor yards that are commonly used by inmates. There's a huge difference between being confined to a 12x12 cell for 10 hours/day (for sleeping), a large cell block for 10 hours/day, and a prison yard (with things like basketball courts) for 4 hours/day versus just being confined to a 12x12 cell for 24 hours/day.

This tends to be the case more for prisons (which are long-term facilities) than for jails (which tend to be shorter term facilities).","1514943302"

In what respect?","1514948304"
"TMac1128","TMac1128","No idea how youre equating the prison environment with living on Earth. When questioned you started describing the different types, sizes, and activities of incarceration facilities. As if basketball in prison and gen pop is nothin but playing sports with your buds and hangin out. ","1514962007"
