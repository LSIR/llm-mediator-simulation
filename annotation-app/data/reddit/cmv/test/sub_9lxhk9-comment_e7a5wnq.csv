I think it's because you don't actually hate living  in America, it's just because you need something to complain about ","1538845778"
"KingOfTheMexica","KingOfTheMexica","The argument of “You don’t like it here? THEN GET THE FUCK OUT!” isn’t a valid argument plus not everybody can afford to move due to financial issues which have occurred with the death of the unions and workers rights in America ","1538845894"
"ChristMasNinja","ChristMasNinja","No one is telling you you have to ""get the fuck out"". I'm offering you a solution. If you really hated living here you could just move to a different country. Plane tickets are not that expensive my guy ","1538846416"
"KingOfTheMexica","KingOfTheMexica","Yeah but that argument and this comment are a lie and you are deflecting bc you’ve been caught. Plane tickets aren’t expensive, uprooting your whole life is tho. ","1538846811"
"ChristMasNinja","ChristMasNinja","How would be moving to a new country be expensive? According to you you would be spending way less money on things like Healthcare, there would be more opportunities for you to make money. You still have not given a reason as to why you don't just move? I haven't been caught you're just avoiding every single argument in this thread. So once again I say, I don't think you actually hate living here, you just want something to complain about","1538847066"
"KingOfTheMexica","KingOfTheMexica","Because moving is expensive because you have to save up, which can still be impacted by literally anything in America if you are middle class and poor, go through the procedures of the new country, make sure you ship your stuff. It’s an expensive and time consuming process that the average person can’t do even if they want too. Also, I’ve answered everything, it’s just the average argument here oozes of stupid nationalism that can accept basic reality ","1538847242"
"ChristMasNinja","ChristMasNinja","Ok so let me get this straight. You hate America, but not enough for you to be inconvenienced to move and save up the money for a plane ticket. There are definitely options for you if you really hated living in America that much. But once again, seems like you would rather complain about it instead of actually doing anything about it ","1538848320"
