I would suggest you actually read about this subject a little more rather than believing communism bad capitalism good just because you were taught so. ","1495466730"
"UGotSchlonged","UGotSchlonged","Capitalism: 65 million unhealthily obese   
Communism: 55 million dead from starvation

Seems roughly equivalent, I suppose.

"Turdboy1066","Turdboy1066","Yup, the famines were because of communism, uh... Wait. Didn't Britain cause famines intentionally in the name of capital? Umm... that was something else. Not capitalism. Wait no seriously, they refused to import grain to India and made the Irish sell the few potatoes that didn't die from blight. That was definitely something else, like uhh imperialism or something.","1495470280"
"UGotSchlonged","UGotSchlonged","Yeah, what's up with all of the whining? Those starving Russians should have felt honored to die for the cause. ","1495472209"
"Turdboy1066","Turdboy1066","You know how many died in India? How many died in Ireland? In South East Asia? Africa? Hell, how many people died for colonial profit in America? Obviously they should have shut up and listened to you for a second and they would know that they don't matter because they don't count as a black mark against the enemy. ","1495472435"
"Mr_Thundernuts","Mr_Thundernuts","Yeah, people dying incidentally is equally comparable to targeted oppression and extermination of people for the greater good.

Yes, by your logic all deaths are justified, by Islamic terrorists and White supremacists alike, since other opposing ideologies have 'killed' people too.","1496327873"
"Turdboy1066","Turdboy1066","Was it ""incidental"" when famine relief was intentionally withheld? What about when local food production was forced to relinquish their products to the crown to be shipped back home?","1496387429"
"Mr_Thundernuts","Mr_Thundernuts","That was acknowledged to be an example of royal tyranny. It's why monarchism is much frowned upon now.

The difference between you and I is that I do not attempt to defend those despicable actions, but condemn both monarchy and communism.

Nice try with the Tu Quoque though. ","1496396680"
