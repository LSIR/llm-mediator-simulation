"thecheebsqueefer","thecheebsqueefer","What were Trumps qualifications out of curiousity. Bankrupting himself numerous times or the tax evasion maybe? Must be his wonderful sense of equality and decency. 

Surely the only qualifications that matter are the will to do right by the people you serve!! To re-introduce justice and fairness into a broken system of governance!?! No ðŸ‘Ž...","1516041011"
"karnim","karnim","Trump's qualifications, or lack thereof, are not pertinent to the post. I recognize it is difficult to remain nonpartisan and on-topic with posts such as these, but please try.","1516041401"
"thecheebsqueefer","thecheebsqueefer","Well thats stupid to say. Its making a comparison between someone people believe to be fit for office against someone that might be. Its right on topic and also, the post is fair. Using the currently elected leader, as an example, in a post about political qualification, in regards to peoples comparitive levels of attainment, is right on the money. 

Was I just meant to say Yes or No without any analysis whatsoever?","1516043153"
"karnim","karnim","I'm saying you should analyze Manning's qualifications. If you were to cut out your entire first paragraph, or leave only the first sentence of the second paragraph even, it would be more relevant. The first paragraph does not speak of Manning's qualifications or lack of in any way.","1516044976"
"thecheebsqueefer","thecheebsqueefer","Surely a basis for comparison is required to make an accurate assessment.","1516050377"
