"shijfmxew","shijfmxew","why should anyone care if losers dont get laid? they should die out.

why should anyone be forced to have a kid if they dont want one? sex is fun. people should be able to have it without risk. 

Combining the two, if there was a higher chance of getting knocked up, those losers would absolutely not get laid. no one would fuck a loser if you have a higher chance of beign stuck with that idiot.","1529967647"
"Reven311","Reven311","I explained, because of sympathy for human beings.  Also, due to economics and the eventual extinction of the human race.  It's just math.","1529968420"
"shijfmxew","shijfmxew","yeah, but did you see my last point, that losers would have a harder time getting laid if there was no BC.","1529969469"
"Reven311","Reven311","False, because without reliable birth control it would immediately increase female dependency on males, even losers.  As women leave the workforce the men will have to be paid more money to compensate for the loss of female labor supply.","1529969698"
"shijfmxew","shijfmxew","false. because women arent idiots and dont want to get knocked up by a loser. and they would try harder to find the best guys.

plus, not everyone is a racist, so most people know the economics you fear can be solved with immigration.","1529969772"
"Reven311","Reven311","My point is these men won't be considered losers once my plan is implemented.  It wasn't very long ago that most of the men were reproducing in Norway.  You forget this is a very recent social change.  Immigrants that are college educated can help with the problem, but we don't need non-english speaking immigrants from mexico who want to mow lawns and scrub toilets.","1529969888"
"shijfmxew","shijfmxew","they are always going to be considered losers. no one wants them. no one will ever want them. 

the social change isnt that more people are losers, it's that no one wants kids anymore. so if you're stuck having kids if you have sex, the losers will be totally sunk.","1529969985"
"Reven311","Reven311","Then why were they successfully reproducing to a large extent in the 1980's?  Obviously someone didn't think they were losers back then, but they do now.  Simple fix is to increase female financial dependency on males again.","1529970092"
"shijfmxew","shijfmxew","what on earth are you talking about? no one wants kids anymore. that s the change. if you force people to have kids, they will fuck less. losers will kill themselves (rightfully) and all will be well because we wont have to feed them when they are old.

plus, plenty of immigration will fix any other problem is immigrants are predominantly young people.

what do you have against immigration?","1529970330"
"Reven311","Reven311","Immigrants with low skills are not needed, only educated ones, but we don't get enough of those.","1529979787"
"shijfmxew","shijfmxew","i dont think internet complainers are needed. but that's life. low skilled people are always needed.

i really dont think you make any sense at all.","1529981554"
"Reven311","Reven311","We have tons of poor people in this country with weak skills to hire for jobs, but they gotta pay a living wage.  You can't have a high minimum wage and uncontrolled illegal immigration.  Choose one.","1529981691"
"shijfmxew","shijfmxew","you cant force people to have babies and expect a healthy society. pick one.","1529981883"
"Reven311","Reven311","Nature forces it when you strip away all the artificial bullshit like birth control pills.  This is how humans survived for millions of years.","1529982168"
