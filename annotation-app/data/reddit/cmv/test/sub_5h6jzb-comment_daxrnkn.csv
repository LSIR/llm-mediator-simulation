"HeartyBeast","HeartyBeast","So actually, your view can be simplified down to 

""Americans who have 'given up' their roots are technically more American than Americans who hold onto their roots?""

You don't need to specify race at all, since I suspect that you would agree that an Irish-American who celebrates St. Patricks Day and drinks Guiness is ""less"" American that a 3rd generation Korean immigrant who doesn't identify as Korean-American and doesn't follow any Korean customs.

Correct?","1481199479"
"stellako","stellako","Yes, that's why I put that statement at the end. To answer your specific scenario - yes, if that Korean person no longer identified as Korean, looking at the balance sheet between the two I'd have to say the 'Korean' was more American. 

It's not a great point to make though because this view is rooted in the reality of America. ","1481199790"

Actually, you had ""White"" on the front - I'm saying word can be removed without affecting your argument in any way.","1481200089"

"HeartyBeast","HeartyBeast","Jolly good. Well, we've changed your view as it is set out in the headline, at least because in the headline you are saying that 'degree of American-ness' is dependent on race, whereas now you're saying it depends on adherence to ""American"" customs. 

The question then beciomes: to what extent is the freedom to enjoy a custom from one's heritage an intrinsic part of Americaness? Quite a lot, I would suggest.","1481200630"
"stellako","stellako","I never said it depended on race. I've said all along that it depends on adherence to American customs as you put it, and that whites do this to a greater degree than Asians or Hispanics, in the America we see today. And this is what makes them more American. Never said or implied that being white in itself made them more American. There's nothing different about my view, you've confused yourself. ","1481200918"

Apart from the whole ""CMV: White Americans are technically more 'American' than Hispanic and Asian Americans."" thing.","1481201808"
