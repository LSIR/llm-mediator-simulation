"NorbitGorbit","NorbitGorbit","Do you assume that in the society where this is commonplace that there are also no treatments for autism after birth? In Gataca the main character uses a variety of techniques to fool people into thinking he is enhanced.","1453776541"

"NorbitGorbit","NorbitGorbit","If the character in Gataca was enhanced, he wouldn't have tried as hard. You might find a child with autism could have a richer life because of it in whatever strange future this is. If you're asking if you should magically fix autism in today's world, that's a different question.","1453778716"

If struggle enriches people's lives, maybe we should assign disabilities to people. This guy will be blind, this guy's arm will be removed at birth, she'll be exposed to lead as a baby, and her sister will have her spine broken /s","1453779621"
"NorbitGorbit","NorbitGorbit","autism in the future could be a kind of superpower, not a disability. the equivalent to your examples would be the blind guy and armless guy are given bionic implants etc...","1453780053"

I won't hold my breath. I'm assuming that in broad strokes, being able to speak, socialize normally, and function in fluorescent lighting will continue to be more beneficial than hyperfocusing one one particular subject and flapping one's hands when excited. ","1453780500"
"NorbitGorbit","NorbitGorbit","given that a high percentage of dotcom wunderkinds are somewhat socially obtuse and hyper focused, people have already gotten the idea which part of that tradeoff is more beneficial, so i wouldn't be surprised if some micro-dose of autism might be popular in the future genetic menu.","1453781227"
"yarhtawor","yarhtawor","I'm not talking about tossing in one gene or another to make a designer baby. In the movie, the example I'm using, that is actually plausible and not a pipe dream, they pick the embryo they want after IVF and bin the rest. You can't just ad ""a dash of autism."" DNA doesn't work that way. ","1453781494"
"NorbitGorbit","NorbitGorbit","the theory going around is that in silicon valley this is already happening the old fashioned way in terms of engineering types having children with other engineering types, basically selecting for autism spectrum traits.","1453781781"
"yarhtawor","yarhtawor","That's fine and dandy for them. I'm an aspie and I know jack shit about programming, and have zero interest in it. Math in general bores me. For everyone who is hyperfocused on programming, you have somebody who obsesses over One Punch Man.
