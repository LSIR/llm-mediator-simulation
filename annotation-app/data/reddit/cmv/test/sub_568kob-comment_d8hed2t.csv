"PrepareForWreckage","PrepareForWreckage","He has not insulted veterans. Questioning why a parent of a dead soldier was quiet during a speech is not insulting veterans and John McCain even has said Trump's remarks on PTSD aren't insulting. I could easily say how ""I can't see how anyone can vote for Hillary with her health issues, her pandering, her lying, her corruption, and her failure as Secretary Of State"".","1475808959"

"PrepareForWreckage","PrepareForWreckage","Or you can just have common sense. Trump saying that some soldiers can't handle it is like someone saying some people can't deal with stress and commit suicide. He didn't say what he said in a derogatory manner.","1475822568"

Is a general statement which refers to every PoW. While not every veteran is a PoW, most every PoW is a veteran.

Not that I expect a T_D poster to be able to understand such ""complicated"" concepts, though.","1475865973"
