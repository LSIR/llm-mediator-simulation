For example, how many abortion protestors, especially those using violence are Muslim vs Christian?","1500417800"

"Rubblepile2016","Rubblepile2016","Ok, so your solution to fundamentalist Muslims in the Middle East or East Africa is what?

The solution to Christian bigots in the US is much easier.","1500422937"

"ABLovesGlory","ABLovesGlory","These are ideas, not solutions.  (They're also not questions btw.)

In what way is the law based on Christianity?  What does the end of all oppression look like, and how do we come to that end?  What laws shall we pass or repeal in order to end oppression?    Does it even require the passage of laws, or instead a social change?  What drives social change?

Now, why don;t we apply these same questions to religious fanatics outside the US?","1500439382"
