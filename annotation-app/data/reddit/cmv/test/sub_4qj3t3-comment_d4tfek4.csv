Clarification, does Tor count as big.  It's a subsidiary of McMillan.  

They stand out as great.  For one, Spin, the 2005 Hugo award winner was on par with anything I've read in any genre.  For two, they offered that book and others in a DRM free humble bundle way before that was cool.  No other publisher would let DRM free ebooks out in the wild.","1467251351"
"RemoveKebabz","RemoveKebabz","I thought I listed Tor as ""big"" but I guess not. Yes I would count Tor as big. I will check out Spin, but that's like 11 years ago and I would say before the ""YOU'RE A FUCKING WHITE MALE!"" attitude took over completely. ","1467254672"

"RemoveKebabz","RemoveKebabz","Martin is a straight up avowed feminist and SJW. I enjoy his books immensely but there are more than a few SJW themes. 

For instance can you list any healthy marriages? Even Ned is constantly lying to Cat. Rape is more common than happy stable honest marriages in ASoIaF. 

And the show is full on girl power stronk wymyn mode currently. 

It's popular but the SJW flavors get overpowering, at least to my pallet. ","1467256102"
