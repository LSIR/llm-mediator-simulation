It is looking like Trump will get less votes than McCain did in 08 and Romney did in 12 yet he will only just lose the popular vote. 

The democrats don't need to do anything special, they just need to pick a candidate that doesn't have so much baggage. 

There is very little you can get out of this election policy wise. This election was not won and lost on policies, it was won and lost on fear mongering and scandals.","1478751689"

"qwertx0815","qwertx0815","i mean, i hope i don't offend you with this, but i see you commenting quite a bit in CMV today, and looking at the body of your post i would just group you into the 'doesn't care about policy, votes based on the image of the candidate and who has the best feel-good slogans.'

most people in that group deceide once and then stick with their side for the rest of their life, you're just more indifferent than the others...","1478788575"
"KRosen333","KRosen333","So... are you criticizing me because I decided differently at age 28 than I did at age 20?  

I mean you know absolutely nothing about me.  How can you possibly even begin to imagine you understand why I made the choices I made?  ","1478794207"
"qwertx0815","qwertx0815","no, i criticize you because i have the impression that you didn't vote because you believe in trump but to spite 'them'.

(on another vote, believing inTrump isn't all that shiny either, at least if you actually listen to what he says...)","1478795465"
"KRosen333","KRosen333","hahahaha isn't that convenient.  I guess it's a good thing I don't care about your criticism.  (\^:","1478796109"
