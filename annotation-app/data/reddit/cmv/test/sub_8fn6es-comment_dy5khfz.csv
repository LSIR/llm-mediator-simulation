"The_Ty","The_Ty","I wouldn't say mass shootings are impossible to avoid, but if you want to talk about how you can come incredibly close to eliminating them, consider that the UK hasn't had a mass shooting since 2010, and the last one before that was 1996

Also I couldn't find a mass shooting which has happened in Japan in the last 30 years ","1524990394"
"SirMonkeyFood","SirMonkeyFood","Van and acid attacks are still commonplace in the U.K.","1525060985"
"The_Ty","The_Ty","Okay? Last time I checked the subject was about mass shootings ","1525071848"
"SirMonkeyFood","SirMonkeyFood","Sorry, I should have elaborated. If you take away guns people still find ways to be violent. People in the UK have been running vans into crowds and throwing highly concentrated acid on people as terror attacks. IMO getting rid of guns is simply restricting our freedoms in exchange for securities that can't be delivered. Mass shootings aren't the problem, they're a symptom of the human capacity for evil.  ","1525094323"
"The_Ty","The_Ty","You make this sound like a common occurrence in the UK. It isn't.

Again, the original post asked specifically guns and mass shootings, not violence, acid or van attacks. Your issue seems to be that I replied specifically to what was asked by the OP","1525115310"
"SirMonkeyFood","SirMonkeyFood","There were nearly 500 acid attacks last year in London alone. It happens more than daily. Guns were banned in the U.K, and other forms of terror attacks took their place.


If you're only interested in solving the issue of shootings then I suppose the conversation is over. My issue is that taking guns and acting like people won't do terrible things is  foolish. We can't ban household cleaning products. We can't ban vehicles. ","1525115679"
"The_Ty","The_Ty","Are you serious?

One more time for the cheap seats. The OP asked about guns, specifically, and mass shootings, specifically. Are you also annoyed I didn't talk about alcohol or obesity since they're responsible for large numbers of deaths? ","1525119052"
"SirMonkeyFood","SirMonkeyFood","No. The subject is gun violence. You pointed out the U.K. has low gun violence rates due to abolishing guns. I pointed out this has, in turn, raised other types of violent crime. Your statement implies that violence rates have lowered.

Again. If you're uninterested in talking about the effects of removing guns on violent crime rates the conversation is over.","1525120138"
"The_Ty","The_Ty","> No. The subject is gun violence

Exactly. I replied to the OP, you can't handle that I was staying on topic. Last time I'm replying about this ","1525121128"
