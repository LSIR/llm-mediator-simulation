It does not require a belief of any superiority to fear that if more people come in who do not share your beliefs that maybe society wont be steered by your own values in the future.","1441632896"
"CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH","CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH","What specific values are you talking about? No country is in danger of losing a their majority in their own countries. In no country will sharia law suddenly be implemented.

America did not see this happen with the mass migration from Asia, Ireland didn't see this with the Balkans immigrating. The only time this does happen is when there is an invasion.","1441633724"
"Shotgun_Sentinel","Shotgun_Sentinel","We actually have seen a value shift in the US from the Irish. They supported more social reforms, and more security reforms which changed the country drastically. That was so long ago that you can't see the difference though.","1441637726"

"Chalools","Chalools","The laws in this country USED to be written for white men. That's a fact. No one else could own land or vote. And, p.s., it wasn't beneficial to all white men. Only the landowners which means the wealthy ones. ","1441671885"

No they never were at all, otherwise there wouldn't be room in the Constitution for civil rights reforms.

> No one else could own land or vote.

Anyone who owned property could vote, and there were black and Indian Property owners.

> Only the landowners which means the wealthy ones.

There were property owners who weren't rich.","1441672198"
