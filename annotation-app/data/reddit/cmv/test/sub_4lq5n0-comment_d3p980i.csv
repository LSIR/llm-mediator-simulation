I support the concept of Selective Service and I enjoy the right to vote, and I think women should be forced to register or face jail time and a lack of government grants and ID the same way we do. Otherwise they're not real citizens, they just get their right to vote for free.","1464653238"

So what? Why mention this? It's meaningless.

> I support the concept of Selective Service and I enjoy the right to vote

The two are unrelated.

America claims to be the land of the free, forcing people to fight a war is not freedom, it's the opposite. One would think if this country is as great as we all think it is forcing people to defend it would not be required.

"SaucyWiggles","SaucyWiggles","Tradition and historical precedence matter. Law doesn't become meaningless when you don't like the law.

No it does not. Reason and rationality matters.

That's EXACTLY when law becomes meaningless, when enough people disagree with it.

> If you enjoy your right to vote, however, you might go fight in a war in order to keep it.

You might VOLUNTEER to go fight for your country if you love your country... we aren't talking about volunteers here are we?","1464665917"
"SaucyWiggles","SaucyWiggles","Historical and traditional precedence do not matter *to you*. There are well over a hundred million people in the United States who think they do matter.

You, as an individual, don't really matter. Your opinion that a law is meaningless doesn't either, because nearly a billion Americans have existed under the law and maintained the Institutions that uphold it. If enough people want it to be gone, it will, but that hasn't happened. To the United States, it still matters.

Pure speculation. Even if you're correct, what is your point, that most people are irrational?

What I said was, quote:

I can't have a debate with you when you are unwilling or unable to form a counterargument based on what I've actually said.","1464669377"
"SaucyWiggles","SaucyWiggles","Your argument is just that a law needs to disappear because you don't like it due to irrationality. You seem to lack an understanding in it's significance prior to our time period, and by setting your ideological standard aside you could more effectively gain one.

My argument is that laws DO disappear when enough people disagree with them and SHOULD disappear when they make no sense and are antithetical to the supposed ideals of our nation.","1464696628"
