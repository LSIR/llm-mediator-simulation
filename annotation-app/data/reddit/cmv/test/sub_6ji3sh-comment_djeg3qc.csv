Exactly, all the factors, such the state of your mind, your experiences - led you to a choice.  

How can the same starting conditions, and the same brain, and the same decisions process - lead to a different choice?

"Hq3473","Hq3473","My point is that the result of your decision making process is predetermined even before you even start.

Sure. But what you will want is predetermined, and so is outcome of your choices.

Brain is a physical objects. As such it follows laws of physics. So it can be expected to behave in a manner predetermined by those laws.

Proof?

Do you claim your brain can violate the laws of physics?

If something is predetermined - where does free will come in?   ","1498446483"
